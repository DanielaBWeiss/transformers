In the 1960s, Malaysia was producing between 60,000 and 70,000 tons of tin annually and employing over 200,000 workers in the industry. </s> After World War II, when the Japanese closed and flooded some mines, production resumed with Malaysian production in 1960 between 60,000 and 70,000 tons.
High wages and the rapid growth of other industries pushed tin off that nation's priority list. </s> Meanwhile, Malaysia has moved away from commodity production and put its capital in modern technologies, electronics, tourism, and real estate.
In 1857 rich deposits were found on the Malay Peninsula and the industry flourished with British concessions and thousands of Chinese immigrant workers. </s> The British initially developed the industry, employing hundreds of thousands of Chinese immigrants. </s> The British began mining tin in the late 19th century in what is now Malaysia.

In 1985 the International Tin Council stopped price supports and dumped 100,000 tons of tin, crushing prices. </s> Tin producers suffered a worldwide crisis in 1985. </s> Beginning in 1985 too much tin had been stockpiled in many countries in the world and was released on the market. </s> Historic Southeast Asian tin producers (Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand) were members of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC), which kept prices supported until 1985 when turmoil struck the industry.
But Brazil and China were not members. </s> By 1993 China and Brazil were major tin producers and, as non-members of the ATCP, were stockpiling and exporting vast amounts of tin, driving the price down. </s> The failure of the ATPC to enforce production quotas, increased production by non- ATPC members such as China and Brazil as well as the entry of new producers Peru, Portugal, and Vietnam, and the US Defense Logistics Agency disposing of large amounts of tin, all served to undermine the tin industry in Southeast Asia.
Several factors explain the slump: the 1985 buffer stock operations collapse leaving 100,000 tons of stockpiled tin on the market; China's export emergence and the Soviet Union's absence from the import market; the US Defense Logistics Agency's selling of tin from stockpiles and the increasing use of aluminum. </s> The collapse of the former Soviet Union, once a substantial consumer of tin, added to the producers' difficulties. </s> The Soviet-bloc had been a big importer.

He reminded them that on an earlier occasion when there appeared to be a majority in favor of devolution, a referendum had produced a contrary result. </s> Major reminded him that results of an earlier referendum, in 1978, showed that only 18 percent of Welsh voters favored a parliament.
At that time, the Welsh Nationalist Party, Plaid Cymru, launched its manifesto urging self-government for Wales within the European Community (EU) noting that it was not just a distant aim but an urgent necessity and essential for democracy. </s> The most recent push for self-rule for Wales became strong in 1992.

Single-sex education is superior for girls. </s> Even though research shows that single-sex education is beneficial for girls, the few women's colleges in the U.S. are struggling. </s> There is statistically significant evidence that girls do benefit more from single-sex schools than coeducational. </s> Single-sex education appears to have definite advantages for girls.
Both girls and boys can forge close friendships and camaraderie in single sex institutions. </s> A minor concern would be that the camaraderie boys enjoy in singe-sex schools would be lost in coed schools, once they begin competing for the attentions of female classmates.
In the United Kingdom single-sex schools are the ones performing better academically with only one school in the top 30 being coeducational before the age of 16. </s> Only one in the top 30 schools was co-educational. </s> In the UK, only one in the top 30 independent schools is coeducational, and 25 of the top 30 state schools are single-sex. </s> Of the top 30 most highly ranked schools in the nation based on test scores, only one was coed.

An untested, anecdotally proffered advantage of same-sex schools is that students are less distracted from studies if emerging sexual-tensions are avoided at least in the classroom.
In addition, girls are often intimidated by the boys, don't take on leadership roles, and fall into the stereotypical gender roles of low interest in math and science. </s> In single-sex schools, girls often excel in these subjects.
