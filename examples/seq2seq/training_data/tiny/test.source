In 1989 Iran asked the court to declare unlawful the 1988 U.S. shoot-down of Iran Air 655 and make the U.S. compensate Iran directly, not individual Iranians. It ordered Albania to compensate Britain for losses when British destroyers struck Albanian-laid mines in the Corfu Channel, heard Iran's suit that the US compensate Iran for an Iranian airliner mistakenly shot down by the US, and heard British Petroleum's arguments when Iran's Massadeq nationalized foreign oil interests.
Sixteen permanent judges preside in the Peace Palace. The Peace Palace is the court's seat.
In 1989 Iran asked the court to declare unlawful the 1988 U.S. shoot-down of Iran Air 655 and make the U.S. compensate Iran directly, not individual Iranians. It ordered Albania to compensate Britain for losses when British destroyers struck Albanian-laid mines in the Corfu Channel, heard Iran's suit that the US compensate Iran for an Iranian airliner mistakenly shot down by the US, and heard British Petroleum's arguments when Iran's Massadeq nationalized foreign oil interests.
It heard Nicaragua's claim that the US illegally aided the Contras and condemned the US embargo and harbor-mining of Nicaragua, prompting the US to walk out in protest. Nicaragua asked the court to rule U.S. aid to the Contras illegal. These include USSR embargos against Lithuania and US support of the Contras, including mining Nicaraguan harbors.
It issues rulings on international law disputes submitted to it by any state. The World Court hears and rules on disputes between countries and violations of international law, such as the British/US-Libyan dispute over extradition of Libyans charged with bombing the Pan Am jet blown up over Lockerbie. The Court hears cases involving disagreements between and among nations. It hears cases involving international disputes.
The World Court found the US guilty of violating international law by mining harbors in Nicaragua. The court ruled illegal the U.S. mining of Nicaraguan harbors. It heard Nicaragua's claim that the US illegally aided the Contras and condemned the US embargo and harbor-mining of Nicaragua, prompting the US to walk out in protest. For example, when it found the United States guilty of illegally mining the harbors of Nicaragua, the US ignored its verdict, but in another case when it sided with the United States, the US worked to enforce the Court's decision.
The court overruled a 1960 U.N. resolution refuting South African control over Namibia, and reversed itself in 1967. It overruled a UN resolution condemning South African control over Namibia but reversed itself 7 years later.
The World Court has no enforcement powers. Although, it does not have powers to enforce its orders, its decisions have traditionally carried some diplomatic weight. The World Court does not have any powers to enforce its orders, but its decisions carry diplomatic weight. The Court does not have the powers to enforce its decisions, but they usually carry diplomatic weight.
The research and development phase for creating new drugs is costly and complicated. Research and development of drugs is a complex, drawn-out, and expensive process. The R&D phase of creating new drugs has become highly costly due primarily to the increasing complexity of the regulatory process, the rapid spread of biochemistry, and the expanding demand for innovative drugs.
"Me-too" drugs similar to what is already on the market are developed only where there is a market advantage from improved safety, effectiveness or treatment cost-benefit. Companies are learning to concentrate only on innovative drugs that seem certain to prove effective and to drop research on those taking too long to develop.
Prospective drugs must have high projected market share; expected superiority in safety, effectiveness, and cost-benefit; and quick profitability or long market life after regulatory approval. The drug must pass the hurdles of safety, quality and efficacy. A company then decides which drug to develop, taking into consideration technological feasibility of producing it, whether it will provide significant advantages in safety or efficacy, and likelihood of commercial success. "Me-too" drugs similar to what is already on the market are developed only where there is a market advantage from improved safety, effectiveness or treatment cost-benefit.
Drug research and development starts with a decision on which therapeutic area to target, based on medical need, potential market size, and understanding of the disease mechanism. Drug companies must be convinced that a market exists for the new product and that the pricing of the finished product will be sufficient to recoup the developmental expenditure. These are funding, facilities construction and staffing, basic science and technology research or acquisition, analysis of new medical therapy needs, and selection of newly found drugs for actual product development based on projected market analysis and expected regulatory approval.
They overcome problems such as delivery into the body. Once discovered, a drug must be synthesized and a delivery system determined.
The process now includes creating public pressure to support the drug, including getting good reviews in medical journals. Companies generate public pressure for licensing and try to make applications compelling reading.
The second phase is clinical trials. This is done with pre-clinical trials, then with clinical trials on humans. After the pre-clinical phase, a potential drug goes into clinical trials. After toxicity tests on animals, drugs are tested for safety on healthy human volunteers.
These typically involve three phases, an average of 200 patients per trial, and are the longest, most costly stages in new drug development. A typical trial involves three phases, with an average of 200 patients per trial.
The company will go forward with an appealing trade name and an attractive and entertaining application package. Companies generate public pressure for licensing and try to make applications compelling reading.
This is done with pre-clinical trials, then with clinical trials on humans. After the pre-clinical phase, a potential drug goes into clinical trials.
Merck's Clin*Net project allows managers to follow the progress of thousands of patients in clinical centers around the world far more effectively than mail or phone. Doctors and their patients are becoming more reluctant to take part, so companies must spend more time and money to recruit hundreds or thousands of people required. Clinical trial preparation requires recruiting hundreds or thousands of volunteers (including sufficient candidate patients), manufacturing adequate supplies of the drug, and writing case study books.
A typical trial involves three phases, with an average of 200 patients per trial. These typically involve three phases, an average of 200 patients per trial, and are the longest, most costly stages in new drug development.
