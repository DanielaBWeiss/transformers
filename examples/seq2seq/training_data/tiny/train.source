On March 16, 1993, with Japanese car import quotas to Europe expiring in two years, renowned cost-cutter, Agnacio Lopes De Arriortua, left his job as head of purchasing at General Motor's Opel,Germany, to become Volkswagen's Purchasing and Production Director. The industrial espionage case involving GM and VW began with the hiring of Jose Ignacio Lopez, an employee of GM subsidiary Adam Opel, by VW as production director. Jose Lopez as head of purchasing at Adam Opel, GMs German subsidiary, led the company to become the most profitable car maker in that country. Lopez was procurement chief at Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary.
VW chairman Ferdinand Piech recruited the General Motors/Opel executive, Jose Lopez de Arriortua. He was presumably recruited by VW chairman, Ferdinand Piech, who was impressed with Lopez's leading role in helping Adam Opel recover from a major production cost disadvantage. A ruthless restructurer, he recruited General Motors' likeminded global head of purchasing Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. Ferdinand Piech had just been installed as Chairman of Volkswagen when he hired Lopez.
He was presumably recruited by VW chairman, Ferdinand Piech, who was impressed with Lopez's leading role in helping Adam Opel recover from a major production cost disadvantage. As early as December, 1992, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, of GM, was in touch with Ferdinand Piech, Chairman of Volkeswagen, about coming to work for VW. European government and industry leaders expressed fear that defensive allegations by VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech, that the Lopez incident amounted to U.S. industrial warfare against Germany, would destabilize U.S.-European commercial and diplomatic relations. VW chairman Ferdinand Piech recruited the General Motors/Opel executive, Jose Lopez de Arriortua.
The investigation is focused mainly on evidence that Mr. Lopez and his associates took GM and Adam Opel industrial secrets with them. Lopez had developed a new GM plant to be built in his native Basque country, but when he learned in March 1993 that it would be built in Hungary he abruptly left GM for VW, with secret GM documents he had requested that detailed GM's new plant and car models. Lopez, disappointed that GM was not going to build a plant in his native Basque country, left GM under a cloud of confusion and allegedly took some sensitive GM documents and plans with him. GM documents and computerized information were seized from a VW headquarters and documents were found at the apartment of the former GM executives, Jorge Alvarez Aquirre and Rosario Piazza.
Then state prosecution officials discovered four boxes of papers, including secrets documents containing plans to build the car where Gutierrez and Piazza, another former GM employee were staying. Lopez had developed a new GM plant to be built in his native Basque country, but when he learned in March 1993 that it would be built in Hungary he abruptly left GM for VW, with secret GM documents he had requested that detailed GM's new plant and car models. The situation became more serious when top- secret documents were found missing from GM that described plans to build a new model car. These included details of Opel's entire European component supplier network and key contact data, plans for a new style, low-cost high-speed car factory, and information on new models.
GM immediately accused Lopez of looting Opel's supply network and contract database and taking secret plans for a high-speed factory and a new Opel mini-car. These included details of Opel's entire European component supplier network and key contact data, plans for a new style, low-cost high-speed car factory, and information on new models.

The industrial espionage battle by General Motors (GM) and its German subsidiary, Adam Opel, against Volkswagen (VW) for the past 18 months has bogged down in mountains of paper and a complex transatlantic tussle involving both lawyers and politicians. The legal cases soon became bogged down in mountains of papers and transatlantic issues between the countries involving lawyers and politicians.
In March 1993, Lopez and seven other GM executives moved to VW overnight.

Britain had hoped to strike an agreement with Argentina that would protect the islands' revenues, but Argentina tied such an agreement to concessions by London over shared development of the islands' possible oil reserves and lifting of the UK's arms embargo. Although the UK and Argentina cooperated militarily during the Gulf War, Britain has maintained an arm embargo preventing Argentina from replacing aircraft shot down in the Falklands War. Britain's arms embargo continues, except for Argentine units participating with Gulf War Coalition forces.

By 1992, worldwide sales of international brands, led by Philip Morris's Marlboro, had grown by seven percent a year over a three-year period, and they continued to gain market share almost everywhere in Europe. Phillip Morris' success was revealed by its increase in exports (24.4% in 1990), overseas sales gains (24% in 2d quarter 1991), and rising international tobacco profits (19.9% in 1992). However, their sales assault overseas; namely, the Far East, has provided a burgeoning increase in profits.
International sales and company profits increased steadily. Although the domestic market for cigarettes in America in the l990s was greatly reduced due to bans on advertising, smoking in public places, and health warnings, American tobacco companies were showing a profit most quarters due to export sales of cigarettes and diversification of products sold including food. Their parent companies, PM and RJR Nabisco, both fared well from outstanding quarterly profit increases from their international tobacco operations, more than from their other divisions. Phillip Morris' success was revealed by its increase in exports (24.4% in 1990), overseas sales gains (24% in 2d quarter 1991), and rising international tobacco profits (19.9% in 1992).
Sales of cigarettes to Western Europe continued to do modestly well in spite of competition from European companies. By 1992, worldwide sales of international brands, led by Philip Morris's Marlboro, had grown by seven percent a year over a three-year period, and they continued to gain market share almost everywhere in Europe. Philip Morris with its world leading Marlboro brand increased sales in France, Italy and Spain.
America's tobacco companies -- namely, Phillip Morris (PM), R. J. Reynolds (RJR), BAT Industries, and Rothman's International -- have taken a more aggressive approach to selling cigarettes. Two U.S. tobacco companies, Phillip Morris and RJ Reynolds, used aggressive, long-term strategies, beyond export sales, to capture new international tobacco markets which privatization had expanded from 60% closed to 95% open.
In Asia, Philip Morris opened a plant in Kazakhstan with an eye to opening in Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Thailand, and particularly China, the biggest world market, as trade restrictions are lifted. Philip Morris signed an co-operation agreement with China, the world's biggest market, to produce Marlboros.

In Asia, Philip Morris opened a plant in Kazakhstan with an eye to opening in Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Thailand, and particularly China, the biggest world market, as trade restrictions are lifted. The opening of new markets abroad is due to the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, China's new open-market policy, the breaking of cigarette monopolies in Western Europe, and an increase in smoking habits in Asia.
Cyanide is used in mining to recover metal from low-yielding ore. Cyanide is used extensively in gold mining through a system called "heap leach" mining, which enables microscopic bits of gold to be economically extracted from low-grade ore. In mining industry applications a 0.1% cyanide-water solution cheaply leaches metals, such as gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead and iron from ore heaps. Cyanide is used in mining to extract precious metals from low-grade ore.
Cyanide is used in tryptophan production. The Japanese use hydrogen cyanide to manufacture tryptophan, an amino acid used as a nutritional supplement. Hydrogen cyanide has been used to produce amino acid nutritional supplements. Another use of cyanide is in manufacturing the nutritional supplement tryptophan.
Philippine fishermen use cyanide in fishing, needlessly destroying immature fish. Sodium cyanide use by fisherman decimates fish. In the Philippines some fishermen use homemade explosives and cyanide for driving fish away from reefs and into nets. Fisheries in parts of the Philippines have been decimated by the use of cyanide in fishing.
Some garden pesticides contain cyanide. Cyanide is used in pesticides and PCP.

Philippine fishermen use cyanide to catch fish. Fisheries in parts of the Philippines have been decimated by the use of cyanide in fishing.
This method decimates the fish population and is linked to the destruction of area reefs. Some Filipinos use cyanide in dangerous and destructive (to coral reefs) fishing operations.
Cameroon honey gatherers use cyanide to stun bees. Cyanide-leaching recovers silver from photographic film; is used to make PCP; and in Cameroon, pygmies harvest honey stun bees with cyanide-laced smoke. Climbers stun the bees with smoking leaves and a cyanide compound. In Cameroon, a pygmy tribe uses smoking leaves and a cyanide compound for stunning bees while retrieving honey.
In Cameroon, a pygmy tribe uses smoking leaves and a cyanide compound for stunning bees while retrieving honey. An unusual use of cyanide is to assist Cameroon villagers to gather honey from hives in tall trees.
Cyanide-leaching recovers silver from photographic film; is used to make PCP; and in Cameroon, pygmies harvest honey stun bees with cyanide-laced smoke. Other uses for cyanide are in galvanizing and other metal plating, in recovering silver from photographs and x-rays, and in fishing. Cyanide is used in the metal plating industry and to recover silver from used film.
Cyanide is used to extract silver from used x-ray films. Cyanide used to recover silver from X-ray film caused the death of a worker when he inhaled fumes from the process. Cyanide is used widely for many purposes but most extensively in gold, silver, and copper mining, in electroplating, x-ray film recovery, and in the production of pharmaceuticals. Other uses for cyanide are in galvanizing and other metal plating, in recovering silver from photographs and x-rays, and in fishing.
Other uses for cyanide are in galvanizing and other metal plating, in recovering silver from photographs and x-rays, and in fishing. In some isolated cases, it is used for fishing and food gathering.
Cyanide used to recover silver from X-ray film caused the death of a worker when he inhaled fumes from the process. An employee at one of these plants died after inhaling cyanide fumes on the job. A film recovery worker died from inhaling cyanide fumes. In 1990, a worker died recovering silver from X-rays.
Cyanide is used in the metal plating industry, where the storage tanks pose a risk of deadly hydrogen cyanide being accidentally released. Other uses for cyanide are in galvanizing and other metal plating, in recovering silver from photographs and x-rays, and in fishing. Cyanide is used in the metal plating industry and to recover silver from used film. Plating companies electroplate metal, such as that used by military and aerospace contractors, by placing it in large cyanide and acid baths.
There is a reported incident of five workers in Indiana dying of asphyxiation when working in an enclosed space in the presence of the cyanide gas. Five plating company workers died when hydrogen cyanide gas was accidentally created while cleaning a holding tank. Five young men working in a California plating plant died in 1989 from inhaling cyanide fumes in a confined space. Cyanide fumes killed five workers cleaning one tank.
Cyanide is used extensively in gold mining through a system called "heap leach" mining, which enables microscopic bits of gold to be economically extracted from low-grade ore. A process known as heap-leach or heap mining is used to extract gold from low-grade ore. The first use in the mining industry, known as heap leaching, is a very economical and efficient way to separate small traces of gold from rock. Cost efficient "heap-leach technology," using cyanide, revolutionized gold mining in the 1970s.
Cyanide is used widely for many purposes but most extensively in gold, silver, and copper mining, in electroplating, x-ray film recovery, and in the production of pharmaceuticals. The heap-leach technique uses a water-cyanide solution to dissolve gold, silver, or copper from the ore. In mining industry applications a 0.1% cyanide-water solution cheaply leaches metals, such as gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead and iron from ore heaps.
Cyanide is used in rodent poison. Cyanide in rodent poison absorbs topically and produces poison gas and toxic run-off in fires.

Environmental problems arise during times of heavy rainfall when ponds overflow and run into natural streams. Mine waste-water poses an environmental hazard. The dangers of cyanide use in gold mining are its potential for environmental contamination. In mining, open ponds of cyanide and toxic metal waste, leak or flood into the environment.
A South Carolina mine's reservoir dam broke and spilled sodium cyanide into a creek. A broken dam spilled cyanide-contaminated water into a creek.
Flora, fauna and humans die from direct contact with concentrated waste; which then flows into tributaries, rivers, lakes and reservoirs, resulting in massive kills of fish, animals and plants, and corrosion of irrigation equipment even 17 miles or more down stream, before cyanide is diluted or deactivated by sunlight. Within a year it had poisoned all the fish in a reservoir 15 miles downstream and threatened irrigation in the valley below. A leak into the Alamosa River poisoned fish in a downstream reservoir and corroded irrigation equipment in the valley. In Summitville Colorado, pollution from a mountain mine killed fish for 17 miles and corroded irrigation equipment.
In Colorado, in 1994, a mine leaked contaminated water into the Alamosa River. A leak into the Alamosa River poisoned fish in a downstream reservoir and corroded irrigation equipment in the valley.
The ore is spread on impermeable plastic pads then sprinkled with a weak cyanide-water mixture. Crushed ore is heaped on an impermeable pad and saturated with a cyanide solution that leaches out metal then drains into a holding pond. Ore is placed on a plastic pad and a weak cyanide solution is poured over it to pull the gold from the rock. On huge plastic pads, heaps of pulverized ore from strip mines are saturated with a cyanide solution.
Ore is placed on a plastic pad and a weak cyanide solution is poured over it to pull the gold from the rock. The process involves piling heaps of ore dug from strip mines and leaching it with a cyanide solution that bonds to the bits of gold. The ore is spread on impermeable plastic pads then sprinkled with a weak cyanide-water mixture. Crushed ore is heaped on an impermeable pad and saturated with a cyanide solution that leaches out metal then drains into a holding pond.
Crushed ore is heaped on an impermeable pad and saturated with a cyanide solution that leaches out metal then drains into a holding pond. The solution-coated ore is then drained into a holding pond where the gold is separated from the solution. In this cost effective method, cyanide bonds to bits of gold and the solution is then drained into holding ponds where the gold separates out. The waste from this process is discharged into self-contained ponds.
A plating company in Hollywood, California was charged with dumping cyanide into the sewer system and with reckless storage of chemicals. Cyanide-contaminated sludge has been dumped into a Brazilian river and California sewers and trash bins. Environmental damage occurred when a leaking holding tank contaminated ground water and when a plating company dumped cyanide-laced waste water into the Los Angeles sewer system. In Los Angeles, dumping of thousands of gallons of cyanide solution from plating operations into sewers occurred several times in 1989 and 1990.

Water diverted for mining use can dry surrounding wells and streams, destroying wildlife habitats. Diversion of water for leaching destroys wildlife habitats.
Cyanide is used in electroplating aircraft parts. Plating companies electroplate metal, such as that used by military and aerospace contractors, by placing it in large cyanide and acid baths.
A pioneering "closed-loop" cyanide leaching system eliminates open ponds and environment leaks. Some mining companies went to a "closed loop" leaching system that does away with open ponds.
In addition, birds and other wildlife are endangered when they see the open blue cyanide ponds and stop to drink from them. The death of hundreds of birds and other wild animals is alleged to have been caused by contaminated mining holding ponds. Thousands of birds and animals die drinking from poisoned waste water ponds. Unfortunately, in some cases runoff from this cyanide process has discharged into ponds with the result that birds and animals were killed.
Several instances have occurred in which cyanide used by electroplating companies has been improperly stored resulting in dangerous situations and causing expensive clean-ups. While the processing systems are generally safe, a number of dangerous situations may occur.
