The government defended their decision saying the mine would generate millions of revenue dollars and create 2,000 jobs. ERA's second uranium mine in the Kakadu World Heritage Area would generate billions of US dollars in revenue and create 2,000 jobs.
In October 1997, the Australian government gave permission to Energy Resources of Australia (ERA) to open the Jabiluka uranium mine on the edge of the Kakadu National Park which is on the World Heritage List, in Australia's Northern Territory. ERA's second uranium mine in the Kakadu World Heritage Area would generate billions of US dollars in revenue and create 2,000 jobs. After a decade of opposing new uranium mines, the Australian government approved construction of the Jabiluka mine in the Kakadu National Park, which is on the World Heritage List. The mine is in Kakadu National Park, which is on the UNESCO World Heritage list of important cultural and environmental sites.
Opposition parties, conservationists and Aboriginal land owners opposed the planned mine. Aboriginal landowners threatened to block mine development. Conservationists and the Aboriginal "Mirrar" owners of the land oppose the mine while ERA insists that its environmental record has been proven by the 16-year operation of the Ranger mine, also located in the Kakadu Park. The government's decision was condemned by environmentalists, who were concerned with the potential for consigning tons of radioactive waste in an environmentally sensitive area, and by opposition parties, who claimed the government ignored the wishes of Aboriginal people in the area.

The prosecution countered by saying there could not be a conspiracy of two people who pretend to be homosexuals, commit a robbery and murder, then claim homosexual panic. At McKinney's trial in October, McKinney's attorney pleaded that McKinney committed manslaughter in five minutes of "gay panic" to a sexual advance from Shepard, because drug and alcohol addicted McKinney had been abused homosexually at age 7 and had consensual homosexual sex at 15. In attempting to get his client a life sentence rather than the death penalty, he argued that McKinney's past, which included sexual abuse as a child, caused him to lash out in rage at Shepard's sexual advances.

Piccard and Brian Jones made a third attempt aboard the Breitling Orbiter III. By late December of 1998, a revamped Swiss/British team, with conditional permission from China to fly over its terrain, prepared for a third attempt at the feat.
On their 18th day aloft, the balloonists began crossing the Atlantic on the last leg of what was expected to be a successful, non-stop, around-the-world balloon flight. They began their Atlantic crossing on their 18th day aloft.
Piccard got Chinese airspace clearance before starting but was limited to a narrow strip, forbidden north of the 26th parallel. They gained vital time by obtaining flight permission from China before taking off. Having gotten permission before their departure, they passed over southern China.

The European Airbus A380 flew its maiden test flight from France 10 years after design development started. The largest passenger airliner ever built, the Airbus 380(A380), took off on its maiden four-hour flight on April 27, 2005 in France.
The European company, Airbus, is the newest competitor with the Boeing Company. The A380 super-jumbo passenger jet surpasses the Boeing 747 and breaks their monopoly.
The A380 is designed to carry 555 passengers, but can be expanded to 800 seats. The A380, carrying between 555 and 840 passengers, was unveiled in January 2005 and test flown in April.
U.S. airlines have not placed an order. No US airline has ordered the jet yet.
First commercial deliveries to Singapore Airlines are scheduled for 2006. Commercial deliveries begin first quarter 2006 to Singapore.
A Toulouse, France assembly line opened in 2004. Toulouse production started in January 2002.
With 159 orders from 16 customers and 100 options, production fell behind demand, raising the price to U.S. $292 million. Airbus has 159 firm orders and 10 options from 16 clients.
France called unreasonable a US-proposed safety review to determine whether A380 turbulence would require greater distances around the plane. The US is studying the potential for turbulence generated by the A380 reflecting safety precautions. The U.S. is investigating whether the jet will need special safety regulations due to the turbulence it generates. Possible A380 air turbulence problems potentially requiring ICAO rule-making, a wing load test failure and passenger injuries during a simulated evacuation did not slow deliveries.
By June 1, 2005 customizing A380s for 15 different client requirements, notably for different passenger entertainment systems, had delayed deliveries up to 8 months, risking millions in penalties. In 2005 the A380 was six months behind schedule and owed millions in buyer compensation. Airlines are seeking millions in damages contractually agreed upon for delays. Airbus executives say the company will have to pay millions in compensation for late deliveries of the A380.
The A380 has passed its emergency evacuation test, an important component toward the super jumbo's official certification for commercial flights.

Many analysts believe the biggest threat to the power grid is from companies using older equipment that is more susceptible to attack and their reluctance to update to new computers. Electrical grid vulnerability has grown as equipment is controlled through the Internet or phone, older equipment becomes susceptible to attack, and electric companies' cybersecurity remains inadequate. Recognized cyber-security improvements need to be implemented more comprehensively, especially against documented threats from Al-Qaida, and older, less secure equipment replaced.
Security experts warned that terrorists could unleash electromagnetic bombs that can be catastrophic. An electromagnetic pulse could damage electrical power systems.

On Sept 30, Merck voluntarily recalled the  pain killer Vioxx, used by almost 2 million, after clinical trials for its use in colon cancer showed unacceptable rates of stroke/heart attack. In 2004, Merck withdrew arthritis drug Vioxx, approved in 1999. VIOXX, an arthritis drug used by 2 million people, was withdrawn from the market by Merck, after determination that use past 18 months increased the risk of heart attack or strokes, one researcher estimating a resultant 30,000 to 100,000 deaths. On September 30, Merck & Co. voluntarily withdrew its arthritis drug Vioxx, prescribed for some 20 million people worldwide, because recent scientific study results indicate that long-term use significantly increases patients' risk of heart attack and stroke over those taking older NSAID drugs.
The FDA said it would strengthen its system for reviewing drug safety and would appoint a special drug safety director. The FDA demands longer testing before approving Arcoxia, already sold in 48 countries. Under Congressional scrutiny, the FDA is changing procedures to elevate attention to and action on drug safety. Responding to criticism that it should have acted sooner, the FDA announced that it would strengthen its system for reviewing the safety of drugs already on the market.
Nonetheless, Merck maintains it was vigilant in monitoring and disclosing information about the safety of Vioxx and disagrees with reports to the contrary. Both Merck and FDA have contested criticisms on their actions related to Vioxx.
Other drug companies rushed to fill the VIOXX vacuum but people were calling for greater review of such drugs. A blitz of drug company advertising urging use of other drugs in place of Vioxx is bewildering patients. With the market demise of Vioxx,  intense competition developed for the lucrative arthritis pain medication market.
In a 1-month period, 10 suspected cases were reported and 9 confirmed, including 4 deaths. The H5N1 strain of Influenza A, commonly termed bird flu, has resurfaced, this time in Hong Kong, where there has been 10 confirmed cases with 4 deaths, victims not restricted to age or sex. A mysterious, deadly influenza strain, H5N1, has appeared in Hong Kong with nine confirmed and ten suspected cases.
Nearby Macao reports no cases. There have been no cases of this "bird flu" outside Hong Kong. The World Health Organization has debated vaccine development and further says it has not become an epidemic and recommend those seemingly exposed build up body resistance through good diet, rest, and exercise.
Chicken exports from the mainland are suspended until better health tests are established. The Central Chinese government temporarily suspended chicken exports.
A joint Hong Kong, U.S., WHO examination of the problem confirmed that the main mode of H5N1 virus transmission was bird-to-human. Preliminary tests indicate that the virus is transmitted from bird to human.
Neighboring Macao officials were concerned but reported no cases. Nevertheless, Macao is prepared for a possible outbreak.
Life in the Chesapeake Bay is threatened by over-harvesting, pollution, parasites, and the introduction of non-native species. Important bay water filters and indicators of the bay's health, oysters were once the mainstay of the region's fishing industry. The Chesapeake Bay's once thriving populations of fish, crabs, and oysters are vanishing and the industries surrounding them have all but collapsed, because the Bay has been over harvested and is heavily polluted from sewage, animal manure, and fertilizers from farms. Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania recognized that the Bay's environmental decline severely affected their economies and in 2000 agreed to actions to save the bay within 10 years, removing it from the national "impaired water" list.
So far, Chesapeake Bay cleanup efforts have been ineffective. Multiple challenges, organizations, and viewpoints hamper attempts to reverse decline and improve conditions of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries.
The Ramseys' attorney, Hal Haddon, said that they don't trust the Boulder police. They deny any involvement and claim police are biased against them.
No suspects have been named or arrests made but parents John and Patsy Ramsey are under suspicion. No one has been charged in the case although both Alex Hunter, Boulder's district attorney, and Mark Beckner, Boulder's police chief, have said that JonBenet's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, fall under "the umbrella of suspicion." No charges have been filed.
In addition to her family, an intruder could be the perpetrator based on some evidence including an unidentified footprint and unidentified DNA. Evidence points to both a family member and intruder. Although prosecutors have only identified the parents as under suspicion, unidentified DNA material in JonBenet's underwear and a shoe print found near the body suggest the possibility of an intruder. Under State law, grand jury proceedings are secret but media speculation says evidence points to either a family member or an intruder having committed the murder.
A goat in France is infected with BSE, the first case of transmission to another species used for human consumption. A French goat was diagnosed with mad cow in 2002, the first known transference to a different specie. A French goat has become the first known case of MCD in a non-bovine animal.
Meanwhile British researchers have discovered a gene that might make some people more resistant to MCD. One gene may protect some people from this disease or create different symptoms according to researchers at University College, London. Research at University College, London suggests that an individual's susceptibility to vCJD varies with genetic makeup.
Japan had its first MCD casualty - a man infected during a stay in Britain. The first death in Japan from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease occurred in February 2004.
Greek fighter pilots, scrambled to intercept the unresponsive Boeing 737, saw an unconscious pilot in the cockpit and oxygen masks dangling in the cabin, suggesting a catastrophic loss of air pressure.

Flight attendant Andreas Prodromou, a student pilot, tried to land the plane but it ran out of fuel and crashed. A crew member with pilot training attempted in vain to control and land the plane, and the final cause of the crash was that the jet ran out of fuel. Another man onboard, probably a flight attendant, attempted to steer the plane just before it crashed.
Both recorders have been sent to France for analysis. The plane's data and cockpit recorders, though damaged, were sent to France for expert examination.
There are media reports that a switch that controls cabin pressure may have been left in the wrong position after a safely check. The plane may have suffered a sudden loss of cabin pressure aggravated by a switch left in the wrong position.
The same aircraft lost cabin pressure in December when a door was not properly sealed. The same plane lost cabin pressure in December after a door was improperly sealed.

Environmentalists and scientists are devising programs to protect rain forests, which aid the climate by cleansing air, and which between 1980-1995 diminished by 450 million acres.
California biologists determined that hornbills must be protected because they reseed the forests. The wide-ranging African hornbill helps reseed rain forests.
The investigation expanded to include present and former government officials and wealth stashed abroad. In November 1998, following months of demands for an inquiry and statements from the government suggesting  one was going on, the investigation became part of a general decree calling for the removal of all traces of corruption, collusion, and nepotism amongst current and former officials, their families and cronies, and businesspersons.
If he fails a third summons the Attorney General's office can legally use force to make him appear. The Attorney General said he would be summoned twice more and could then be brought in by force.
Soeharto failed to respond to summons in February and March 2000 claiming illness. A third summons was promised. The Indonesian Attorney General has summoned Soeharto to his office twice, but Soeharto has not appeared, claiming ill health from a stroke the previous year. Within three months, a new Attorney General said Soeharto was a suspect and summoned him to appear. Soeharto has been summoned twice to the AGs office but declined due to health reasons.

The Philippine rebel group Abu Sayyaf claims responsibility but authorities are skeptical. The assailants, carrying AK-47s and a rocket launcher, claimed to be members of a small radical Muslim group fighting for an independent state in the Philippines. The Philippine Muslim rebel group Abu Sayyaf, who demanded the release of Arab terrorists held in US prisons, claimed responsibility, although authorities were skeptical. A Philippine Muslim separatist group, Abu Sayyaf, claimed responsibility for the abductions, but neither this claim nor location of the 20 captives has been confirmed.
Philippine officials confirmed the hostages kidnapped from the Malaysian island Sipadan were being held somewhere on the Philippine island of Sulu by the Abu Sayyaf group, who was demanding a $2.4 million ransom. Eight days after the abduction, rebels allowed a doctor and several journalists to visit the hostages, held on a southwest Philippine island by 50 or more gunmen. Hostages are held by 40-50 gunmen in Talipao in Sulu Province. On April 26, 2000 Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado confirmed the hostages' location in Sula Province and that Abu Sayyaf participated in the abduction.
Nur Misuari isn't replaced as negotiator. The Philippine Government was negotiating for their release, refusing a rebel demand for direct negotiations with the captives' countries. President Joseph Estrada appointed Nur Misuari, governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, as the government's negotiator with the kidnappers who were demanding U.S.$2.4 million in ransom.
Abu Sayyaf rejected Nur Misuari and threatened to behead some of the hostages. Kidnappers threaten to behead hostages if MNLF head
From October 1998 to February, food produced in the United States was tainted with Listeria, E. coli, enterotoxigenic E. coli, and lead, causing recalls of products. One recall for E. coli and one recall of baby food containing lead resulted in no illnesses. According to the FDA, between 1988 and 1998 there was a fivefold increase in food products recalled for E.coli and Listeria bacteria and other life-threatening contaminants. In November, IBF recalled beef possibly containing E-coli, which causes kidney failure and anemia.
According to the FDA, between 1988 and 1998 there was a fivefold increase in food products recalled for E.coli and Listeria bacteria and other life-threatening contaminants.

However, a hitch developed when a judge balked, wanting more information and changes to the plea. Ric Ridgeway of the State Attorney's Office said new plea deal would be proposed. Objections by a Marion County judge may change the plea deal.
In response, Marion prosecutors then dropped all charges, concluding that the emotional welfare and privacy of the victim was more important than sending LaFave to prison. The Debra LaFave saga ended in March 2006 when Marion County prosecutors dropped all charges against the teacher. Marion County prosecutors dropped the charges against Deborah Lafave after they concluded that the victim's emotional state was more important than a prison sentence for Lafave. That afternoon, prosecutors dropped Marion county charges and the penalties against Lafave remained those in the Hillsborough agreement.
He also was presented with psychiatric opinions concerning damage to the victim's emotional state that a trial could cause. On Wednesday, March 8, a psychiatrist testified a trial would harm the boy.
Media attention motivated the victim's mother to seek such a decision. She was approached by Matt Lauer and Nancy Grace, the British tabloid News of the World wrote of the "school miss".
The outcome negated the decision of Marion County Judge Stancil, who felt prison would be appropriate for LaFave. This means the previously agreed-upon deal will stand. That afternoon, prosecutors dropped Marion county charges and the penalties against Lafave remained those in the Hillsborough agreement. Therefore, LaFave will live under the plea deal reached in Hillsborough County of three years house arrest and seven years probation.
Australia strongly opposes Japan's plan to increase its authorized kill of whales in Antarctic waters at the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission opening May 30, 2005 in South Korea. Japan plans to seek permission to expand its so-called research whaling program when the International Whaling Commission (IWC) meets in late May, intending to nearly double its annual catch of minke whales and to hunt endangered humpback and fin whales.

The National Wildlife Foundation supports the move; the Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, and other powerful environmental organizations oppose it.
New York is the 7th state to require helmets for skateboarders; cyclists and inline skaters already covered by law. Helmets can protect baseball batters, skateboarders and in-line skaters and are required in some states. Helmets are required for participants in baseball, football, equestrian events, in-line skating, and hockey. New York state law requires bicycle riders, in-line skaters and skateboarders under 14 to wear helmets.
In some jurisdictions motorcyclists are required to wear helmets. Laws mandating the use of seatbelts and cyclist helmets should be enforced. Countermeasures include cyclists' helmets' being mandatory in Argentina and Uganda, strongly advised in the ASEAN nations, and recommended for Australian cowboys and mounted sheepherders. New traffic laws in Argentina and Uganda require motorcycle helmets.
In 2004, only 20 states require this helmet. Twenty states require helmets for all riders; other states have under-18 rules. Washington, D.C. and 20 states mandate helmets now.

Ephedra, a diet supplement and herb containing ephedrine, is a heart stimulant that may cause physical and mental problems, and death.
Ephedra can produce an amphetamine-like rush, and is used to make methamphetamine. Pure ephedrine can be used to make methamphedamine, a highly addictive street drug, but in controlled dosages it is prescribed for colds and asthma.
but ephedra can harm people with hypertension. It can be dangerous to people with certain underlying health problems.
The agency will try to find new ways to address safety concerns. On February 25, the FDA notified Congress that it is launching a new push to address public safety issues posed by ephedra use. In 2000 the FDA launched a new push to address ephedra's safety issues and include warning labels.
Small doses can trigger devastating reactions in people with unknown susceptibilities. However, despite reports that even small doses can trigger devastating reactions, industry research maintains it is safe in proper doses.
Up to half of the world's mangroves have disappeared in the last 20-30 years because of the development of tourist resorts and commercial prawn farming. Up to half of the world's mangrove swamps have disappeared in the last 20-30 years because of the development of tourist resorts and shrimp farms. Eased regulations allowing development of tourist, transportation, and aquaculture facilities have caused half the world's mangrove swamps to disappear in the last 30 years.
Bangladesh's project to protect the Sundarbans, part of the world's largest remaining mangrove area, lost funding. Malaysia made additional efforts for protection, Sri Lanka enacted laws for protection, Bangladesh sought unsuccessfully to obtain loans for forest protection, and Indonesia gave first priority to forest conservation.
The mangrove forests took a terrible beating and more than 60,000 acres of mangroves were seriously harmed, but the forests absorbed much of the power of the waves and thus helped to protect the coastline and save lives. Over 60,000 acres of coastal mangroves were damaged.
Snorre A and neighboring Vigdis were shut down for over a month, costing 205,000 barrels of oil daily. Most workers were evacuated and oil production halted. A November 2004 natural gas leak on Norwegian Statoil's Snorre A oil platform in the North Sea caused the shutdown of production from Snorre A and neighboring platform Vigdis, resulting in a cut in oil output of 205,000 barrels a day for Norway and costing Statoil 1.4 million Euros daily. On November 28, 2004 Norway's Statoil closed the SnorrA and Vigdis oil platforms in the North Sea.
Operator Statoil pumped in drilling mud to push back gas and seal the leak with cement, in constant contact with technical experts. The leak was contained then Statoil began pumping drilling mud into the injection well.
This closure dropped Norway's production by 205,000 barrels per day, costing Statoil $1.8 million a day. A November 2004 natural gas leak on Norwegian Statoil's Snorre A oil platform in the North Sea caused the shutdown of production from Snorre A and neighboring platform Vigdis, resulting in a cut in oil output of 205,000 barrels a day for Norway and costing Statoil 1.4 million Euros daily. Statoil is losing $1.8 million daily.
Full 205,000 bpd was approved January 24th, after restarted production stabilized and repairs were complete. Full production permission was given in late January but achieving it will take time said Statoil. Two months after a November 2004 natural gas leak halted production on two of Norwegian Statoil's oil platforms in the North Sea, the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority (NPSA) approved the company's plan to resume full 205,000 barrel a day production. Approval to resume full production at the two Statoil platforms was given on January 24.
Statoil admitted the leak resulted from inadequate planning and appreciation of risk, and failure to observe governing documentation. Statoil's internal investigation acknowledged inadequate planning and a lack of risk appreciation led to the leak. This was attributed to inadequate planning and risk appreciation and failure to observe safety rules.
An investigation by Norwegian state officials in coordination with NPSA for possible criminal negligence revealed 28 failures to meet regulations before the leak, harshly criticized Statoil, and ordered comprehensive improvements. The investigation should be done by late March. Statoil was investigated for possible criminal negligence. Police began investigating Statoil to determine if there was criminal negligence. The police were investigating for criminal negligence.
Norwegian safety officials issued a highly critical report on Statoil's failures and ordered improvements in four key areas, including improving management involvement and compliance with controlling documents. An investigation by Norwegian state officials in coordination with NPSA for possible criminal negligence revealed 28 failures to meet regulations before the leak, harshly criticized Statoil, and ordered comprehensive improvements.

Samsung's chief and two other top Samsung executives have been cleared of suspicion.
There was also a dramatic increase in the number of hermaphrodites among frogs during the period when DDT and other pesticides were widely used. Frog populations are declining worldwide due to deforestation, pollution, habitat loss, climate change, pesticides, parasites, non-native predators, the fungal disease chytridiomycosis, hermaphroditic frogs caused by DDT and Atrazine, and over-harvesting for food and medicine. Threats to amphibian survival include chemically polluted streams, destruction of rain forests, pesticides which can trigger hermaphroditism, climate change, thinning ozone layer, over harvesting for food and medicine, and even the closing of Australia's only frog hospital.
Frogs are important sentinels for environmental problems because of the sensitivity of their permeable skin. Scientists view amphibians as "canaries in the coal mine", their demise possibly presaging decline of human life. Amphibians' permeable skins and habitats make them an important indicator of environmental quality. Frogs are very important indicators of environmental change because their permeable skin is extremely sensitive to any changes.

Frogs are important sentinels for environmental problems because of the sensitivity of their permeable skin.
To reverse this trend, we must protect their habitat in part by creating parks and reserves, reduce emissions, and breed them in captivity. Remedies to decline include creation of parks and reserves, reducing climate change emissions, and breeding amphibians in captivity to sustain vulnerable species. Creating ecological reserves, reducing emissions that contribute to climate change, and breeding frogs in captivity can help sustain species. Corrective actions include reducing emissions that contribute to climate change, creating parks and ecological reserves, and breeding frogs in captivity in order to sustain vulnerable species.

International groups have proposed a $404 million effort to preserve frogs and other amphibians, noting that one-third of the known species are threatened globally.
The U.S. sprayed 19 million gallons of the defoliant Agent Orange (containing dioxin) over South Vietnam from 1962 to 1971, exposing two million Vietnamese and 2.1 million U.S. military. Any American who served in the war is automatically presumed to have been exposed to the defoliant.

It has a lingering toxic component called dioxin, which has been linked to three kinds of cancer and chemical acne among the Vietnamese and in Americans fighting there, as well as birth defects in their children. In 1999 Vietnam began a survey to find the exact number of sufferers, but 70,000 are known An estimated 300,000 Vietnamese victims include local residents, soldiers, and their children and grandchildren. Vietnam estimates that up to 2 million of its citizens suffer from Agent Orange-associated ailments, but its studies are discounted by Western experts for lack of stringent methodology. Vietnamese veterans and civilians have various ailments and their children suffer from physical deformities and mental retardation.

Evidence links Agent Orange to adult-onset diabetes. A controversial 2000 US Air Force report indicates "particularly strong" evidence linking Agent Orange to diabetes in veterans involved in spraying the defoliant. Also in 2000, a $140 million, 25 year, Air Force study linked Agent Orange with adult-onset diabetes and found higher incidences of heart disease and high blood pressure in victims. A new Air Force report acknowledges evidence linking Agent Orange to cases of diabetes, with a direct relationship between severity of the disease and levels of dioxin in the body.
