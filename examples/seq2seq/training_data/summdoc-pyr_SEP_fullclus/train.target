Low-income Americans face problems in finding housing
Real or proposed measures include incentives or requirements to encourage the creation of subsidized housing units
There is not enough low-cost housing in the United States
In 1995 there were 4.4 million more low-income earners than there were low-cost housing units
One reason landlords were dropping out of rent subsidy programs is to convert the real estate to condominiums
Grants were made to non-profit organizations to build or rehabilitate apartments for the elderly and disabled
One jurisdiction was granting builders greater density construction for reserving a percentage of units to rent below market value
Raising the minimum wage also was proposed
There were two low-income renters for every low-cost unit
Three-fifths of all poor renters spent more than halve their income on rent
There were large concentrations of extremely poor people in dysfunctional public housing projects
The working poor pay more than half their income for housing
Republicans and Democrats disagreed on the resolution to the problem
Republican favored giving more subsidized rental units for the working poor and Democrats favored subsidizing the poorest in the nation.
The two parties passed a bill that provides a $822 million program that would help the elderly and disabled
HUD will increase payments
HUD will provide other incentives to landlords who participate in subsidized housing programs

Bill Clinton vetoed $144M from a defense spending bill.
The LIV allows the president to alter a law after passage, thereby creating a new law not voted on by either house of Congress.
The LIV unconstitutionally violated the principle of separation of powers.
A constitutional amendment would be required to institute line item vetoes.
President Clinton expressed his deep disappointment.
Congress could restore vetoed items in a new bill passed by majority vote.
Line-Item Veto Act went into effect January 1997
In October 1997 Congress overrode the president's line-item veto against 36 of 38 military construction projects
Proponents argued that the line item veto preserved the integrity of federal spending
Bill Clinton is the only president to have had line item veto authority.
In January 1997, Bill Clinton vetoed 163 times in six bills.
In 1998, Bill Clinton vetoed 82 line-items in 11 bills.
The challenge was dismissed by the Supreme Court.
District Court declared the LIV unconstitutional.
The line item veto is a departure from the basic constitutional requirement that presidents accept or reject bills in their entirety.
