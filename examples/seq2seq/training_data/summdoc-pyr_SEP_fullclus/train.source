Risk of dying from breast cancer fell because drugs prevent recurrence and earlier-detected tumors are smaller. </s> Breast cancer survival rates have improved because of better screening, leading to detection of smaller tumors when the cancer is still localized.
Combined chemotherapy and hormone therapy cut death in half within 15 years from recurring breast cancer. </s> The analysis found that where both chemotherapy and hormone therapy were appropriate, the risk of death within 15 years of diagnosis could be cut in half, so that if a 50-year-old woman had a 1-in-5 chance of dying from her cancer, the drugs could bring the risk down to 1 in 10.
There are two new drugs for breast cancer - herceptin and avastin. </s> The drug Herceptin will soon be added to chemotherapy as a standard part of post surgical treatment for some breast cancer patients.
Herceptin reduced HER2-positive gene-associated breast cancer recurrences 52 percent. </s> The results of the two new trials, sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, showed that Herceptin reduced recurrences by 52 percent on top of those other therapies. </s> Indeed, the two trials were stopped about two years early because they had already established that Herceptin cuts recurrences and prolongs survival. </s> Herceptin halves risk of recurrence in women with tumors high in protein HER2.

Others pointed out that information like a power plant's maximum capacity, and its state of repair on any given day, was now considered proprietary and so was not readily available to system operators, which manage regional power grids. </s> As companies specialized more in generation or transmission, supervisory data became proprietary and unavailable to regional grid managers. </s> Utilities now have little incentive to invest in transmission lines, keep reserve power to minimize shortages, or share information on power plant operating status. </s> Power plant capacity and its state of repair are proprietary now and not available to system operators who manage regional power grids.
Deregulation resulted in lower margins for reserve power capacity and transmission capacity, as well as loss of experienced personnel. </s> The North American Electric Reliability Council, whose members come from utilities, marketers, customers and federal agencies, said in a paper submitted for the meeting that the increased demands that deregulation's wider trading had placed on the transmission system "require the grid to be operated closer to its reliability limits more of the time than was the case in the past." </s> Market participants prefer lower margins to drive up prices. </s> Plants operate closer to reliability limits more often.
