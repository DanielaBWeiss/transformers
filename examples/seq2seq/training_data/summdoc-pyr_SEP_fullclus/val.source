Drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, poor education, teen births, and lack of jobs creates unemployment 10 times the national average. </s> Frustrated by years of distressing results, schools and groups like the National Indian Education Association have begun pressing states and the federal government for more money for academics and crumbling buildings, programs to train Indian teachers, and support for parents whose poverty, substance abuse or unemployment leave them unmotivated or unable to help their children stay in school and achieve. </s> Expensive problems that keep people out of work, such as drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, poor education and teen births, and lack of jobs, are more prevelent in Indian communities, he noted. </s> WASHINGTON (AP) -- They come into Elaine Newton's court by the dozens, charged with underage drinking, using marijuana, fighting. </s> Neah Bay, like many other Native American communities, is struggling with unemployment rates often exceeding 50 percent, deep poverty and the problems of crime, drug and alcohol abuse and domestic violence. </s> Smith and thousands like her are seeking help for their substance abuse at the American Indian Community House, the largest of a handful of Native American cultural institutions in the New York area. </s> Life on most Indian reservations is marked by extreme poverty, drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, failed education, rising crime rates and high unemployment. </s> Over all, the rate of substance abuse among Native American adults is over 20 percent nationwide. </s> Indian communities have greater than average occurrences of such problems as drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, teen pregnancy, poor education, and unemployment.
Zhen said, for quite a long time, many people believed that the wetlands were useless mud. </s> Once thought to be useless mud, they are now known as important as filters for water prior to entering rivers and lakes.
HANOI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam and the World Bank (WB) signed here on Thursday two development credit agreements for Vietnam's coastal wetlands protection and development project and the rural transport project in amounts of 31.8 million U.S. dollars and 103.9 million U.S. dollars respectively. </s> The World Bank is approving loans to Vietnam for wetlands protection and development projects.
These areas play important roles in filtering and cleansing water, in serving as a reservoir for flood water, and in harboring fish and shellfish populations. </s> Wetlands in the Pinelands and throughout the state are supposed to be off limits to development because of their value as a wildlife habitat and a water cleansing system. </s> They serve as a habitat for numerous varieties of flora and fauna, many of which are quite rare. </s> The wetlands are necessary for water conservation, flood prevention, adjusting weather and maintaining the varieties of organisms.
The ineffective nationwide permit system was tightened in 1996 to require individual permits for projects of 3-acres instead of 10, then in 2000 half an acre, and one-tenth an acre in the NY City watershed. </s> The rules would require developers to secure a permit from the Corps for all projects affecting a half-acre of wetlands or more, down from the current minimum of three acres.
"History has told us that the protection of wetlands represents the protection of ourselves, for the destruction of wetlands means the destruction of man's living environment," the minister said. </s> Wetlands, so important to humans as well as wildlife, are endangered by human draining and development in many parts of the world.
Exercise, weight loss, support groups, and self-help courses also have been found to reduce osteoarthritis pain. </s> Researchers are also looking at an antibiotic doxycycline and vitamins C and E. There is general agreement that sufferers from arthritis benefit from weight loss and exercise. </s> Exercise - especially gentle and progressive resistance exercise that strengthens leg muscles - is getting increased attention among arthritis researchers. </s> Treatment can involve medicines, surgery, and nontraditional approaches, as well as exercise and weight control. </s> Many primary-care physicians are unaware of aggressive treatment strategies that go beyond medications, the Arthritis Foundation found, despite research showing the value of support groups, exercise classes and other complementary therapies. </s> Weight loss and exercise are recommended. </s> A Tufts University study presented at the Boston rheumatology meeting showed a home exercise regimen improved leg strength by 71 percent and reduced arthritic knee pain by 36 percent.
The largest of its kind, published this month in the journal Osteoarthritis and Cartilage, looked at how glucosamine-chondroitin affected pain and movement in 93 patients with arthritic knees. </s> The two together appeared to reduce knee pain after 8 weeks. </s> His conclusion, outlined in an article earlier this year in the Journal of the American Medical Association, was that the overseas clinical trials do show that glucosamine and chondroitin reduce pain in osteoarthritis sufferers and are safe.
Until now, these patients and others in chronic pain have relied mostly on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, sold over-the-counter or at prescription strength under brand names such as Advil, Daypro, Lodine and Naprosyn. </s> Older NSAIDS include Advil, Daypro, Lodine, Naprosyn.

In January 1999 the National Transportation Safety Board asked all states to set up "fitting stations" which could install and inspect child safety seats. </s> WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government should set up a nationwide network of fitting stations for child seats to help save children's lives in car crashes, the National Transportation Safety Board recommended Wednesday. </s> Another safety agency, the National Transportation Safety Board, called attention to the problem of wrongly installed seats, urging creation of a network of permanent "fitting stations" for child seats that the government, automakers and private safety agencies would operate jointly. </s> The company's move follows a recommendation by the National Transportation Safety Board in January that a nationwide network of "fitting stations" for child seats be established to prevent the deaths of children in automobile accidents.
The document includes evolution and "intelligent design" - the theory that life happened intentionally, not by chance - under the heading "historical science." </s> Some proponents of divine creation have organized a concept, called creationism, that they proposed be taught along with evolution. </s> They want evolution to be fairly represented and juxtaposed with other theories of life, including the idea that the design and complexity of the design of the cosmos require an intelligent designer. </s> Both Ellsworths believe there's room in the science classroom for more than one theory on the origin of life. </s> "I see the theory as saying, 'It is legitimate to have, as part of the tool kit for science education, the option to say that the things we see in nature may be designed or could have been designed,"' he said.
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said today that Russia did not intend to retake control of Chechnya by force, but wouldn't bargain with the militants either. </s> By 1999, under Putin, Russian air raids continued escalating along the Chechen border to combat aggression.
The Russians sent in some 30,000 troops to partition Chechnya and push the rebels into the mountains. </s> With Russian warplanes hammering targets in Chechnya for an eighth day, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said an unspecified number of the estimated 20,000 to 30,000 Russian troops in the area had moved into positions inside Chechnya.

External safety measures include security checks by armed officers assigned to the schools, student identification cards, random locker inspections, metal detectors, panic buttons in the classrooms, video cameras on school buses, and erection of fences, increased lighting, and trimming of shrubbery around the school. </s> These preventive measures included posting armed security officers in schools; using metal detectors and surveillance cameras, conducting searches for weapons in schools; tightening access to campuses and improving screening for school visitors; locking most school entrances during the school day; installing a hot line and tip box for reporting incidents that might lead to violence; expelling students who bring a gun to school; requiring school uniforms; making it harder to conceal a weapon by requiring transparent book bags and forbidding baggy clothing. </s> At Seattle's Ballard High School, principal Chuck Chinn followed the advice of district security officials and recently stepped up locker checks and random sweeps of students with hand-held metal detectors, a procedure that had only occasionally been used before the Colorado killings. </s> Experts say that's probably because they stress such prevention measures as metal detectors, increased security, school uniforms, parental involvement, alternative schools and conflict-resolution programs. </s> And in towns as small as Allen, Texas, many students returning to school will find metal detectors and armed security guards at the door, while others will have to trade their battered canvas backpacks for see-through bags designed to make it harder to conceal a weapon. </s> Fort Bend doesn't have metal detectors in its schools but does have district police officers at middle and high school campuses, video surveillance cameras in some schools and a student crime-stopper number to report incidents to administrators. </s> Physical building security measures include removing lockers, on-campus armed guards, metal detectors, gun- and bomb-sniffing dogs, and video surveillance. </s> That shooting led to the widespread use of metal detectors, now installed at 70 city schools. </s> Some of these measures are modifications or additions to the school's physical plant such as installing metal detectors and surveillance cameras, keeping most doors locked, removing lockers that could be used to store weaponry, removing things that could provide concealment for a sniper. </s> "Metal detectors, cameras and K-9 task forces will not scare violence away from the students, it will only scare the students; if the violence is in the students it will get inside the schools," Bresky writes. </s> While school safety measures such as metal detectors or additional security officers can be expensive, Stone estimated the cost of the software to be less than $2 per student.
The five were pelted with bottles by enraged crowds, and could face perjury charges. </s> -- The five men suspected of murdering Stephen Lawrence could face perjury charges after their two days of evidence ended Tuesday with them fleeing from the inquiry building under a hail of missiles from an angry crowd.
The Lawrence family has called for Condon to resign. </s> Stephen's parents, Jamaican immigrants, publicly pursued justice for their son, even bringing two suspects to civil court. </s> But Neville and Doreen Lawrence pushed for answers from what they said was a high-handed police department. </s> The government, which has received praise from backers of the Lawrence family for its pursuit of the case, came in for criticism on Monday for actions it took this weekend to prevent publication of a leaked version of the report, which is due to be made public on Wednesday. </s> However, the determination of Lawrence's parents to seek justice kept the issue alive. </s> The Lawrences, whose dignity and tenacity in demanding justice has impressed many Britons, have repeatedly called for Condon to step down, saying someone has to be accountable for the incompetence and racial insensitivity by police that allowed their son's killers to escape prosecution.

Donaldson Adoption Institute, a New York-based research center that Freundlich heads; and the Korea Society. </s> Korea is the first nation from which US citizens systematically adopted children. </s> The Korean-American children were the first such large group to be adopted. </s> Although scattered international adoptions took place after World War II, families in which the children looked markedly different from the parents began to appear after the Korean War. </s> International adoption by US families notably traces to adoption of Korean orphans after the Koran War. </s> Bertha Holt, whose family's struggle to adopt Korean orphans in the 1950s led to a movement that found American homes for thousands of children from overseas, died on Monday at her home in Creswell, Ore., after a stroke on July 24. </s> Between 1955 and 1960, 3,500 Korean children were adopted by American and European families.
For American black and Hispanic children adopted into white families, there are fewer formal supports. </s> The first children adopted from foreign countries had only their adoptive parents for support and often suffered from discrimination.
International festivals are being planned, a local therapist has volunteered to counsel the families, and local Ethiopians have agreed to make frequent visits to provide lessons on the African culture, such as how to cook injera, an Ethiopian staple that resembles a spongy bread. </s> Families join adoption-support groups and children have opportunities to attend play-groups with similar families and go to culture camps.
ADHD, a common psychiatric illness that affects 3-9% of all children, is difficult to diagnose because there is no easy test like a blood test. </s> What Furman was treating himself for, he found out, was a psychiatric condition most often associated with children - attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. </s> ADHD is a neurological and genetic disorder that, Barkley said, is the most widely inherited trait of any psychiatric disorder.
Outward symptoms generally include impulsiveness, inability to concentrate, difficulty in learning, and restlessness. </s> Both groups surpassed the average for inappropriate behavior associated with ADHD, including restlessness, difficulty staying seated, interrupting, not listening and fidgeting.
"One of the key questions in the evaluation is has the child always had difficulty sitting still, sustaining attention to a task, or is this something new," said Gold, who added that often behavioral and other educational help is tried first before approaching medication. </s> Behavior-modification therapy is the primary treatment in Britain but in the U.S. drugs have been found more effective. </s> In December, a landmark study by the national institutes on treatment of the disorder found that the drug Ritalin was more effective than behavioral-modification therapy, which is what is primarily used in Britain.
Adderall, a mixture of two kinds of amphetamines, is effective for treating ADHD and is used largely for children who don't respond to methylphenidate. </s> Medical experts and the drug's manufacturer say that despite the slaying, Adderall remains a safe and effective drug for controlling attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.
It is difficult to diagnose ADHD because there are other kinds of problems, such as anxiety and depression, that may cause the same symptoms. </s> Gold said that part of the difficulty of diagnosis of a psychiatric disease, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is that there are other kinds of problems that cause children to have problems sitting still or to concentrate, such as environmental exposure to lead, stressful household situations and in most extreme case, response to abuse.
Severe marital stress or financial stress in the household can affect the child, and other psychiatric problems can overlap or mimic ADHD, such as severe anxiety. </s> It is difficult to diagnose ADHD because there are other kinds of problems, such as anxiety and depression, that may cause the same symptoms.
Ritalin has side effects including sleeplessness and loss of appetite. </s> But authors of the study -- which involved 212 boys, including 75 with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD -- said the findings should help allay concerns that giving children potentially addictive drugs such as Ritalin may promote harmful habits later. </s> But last fall, when Kyle started second grade, the Ritalin and extra help didn't seem to do much good.
Recently, the American Academy of Pediatrics has established guidelines to make it easier to identify those really in need of help. </s> The American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday issued its first guidelines for ADHD, hoping to eliminate incorrect diagnoses and make sure untreated children get the help they need. </s> For a diagnosis of ADHD under the new guidelines, a child must exhibit symptoms in at least two settings, such as at home and at school. </s> In 2000, for the first time the American Academy of Pediatrics set specific guidelines for diagnosis of ADHD. </s> The academy said it believes the new guidelines will standardize the diagnosis and make it easier to identify which children really need help.

Tens of millions of dollars have been donated for Katrina animal rescue. </s> Tens of millions of dollars have been donated to pet charities because of Hurricane Katrina, but weeks after the storm, abandoned animals are still a major concern. </s> Unprecedented millions of dollars are being donated for pet rescue effort. </s> To help return pets to their owners, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Humane Society of the United States have established a fund to help pay transportation and other costs, said Karen Medicus, ASPCA project director based in Austin. </s> But the plight of pets in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina did more than just soften the hearts of the nation's animal lovers -- it opened their wallets. </s> Animal advocacy groups said the level of giving to pet charities does not mean the donors value pets above people.
"We want a policy to say that local, state and federal responders should actively assist animal rescue," he said. </s> Emergency responders are voluntarily assisting but humane societies are requesting a policy that local, state and federal responders will diligently assist with pet rescues. </s> As thousands of animals remain stranded in hurricane-ravaged Louisiana, trapped in homes or roaming evacuated streets, the head of the Humane Society complained Friday that authorities have ignored pleas to set a policy for animal rescues.
Critics say the proposal for pet evacuation goes too far. </s> Rescuing people takes priority but the Humane Society and a bill in Congress urge pet evacuation also. </s> If Hurricane Katrina causes Congress to create a government safety net for the nation's pets, Rep.

Greer of Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Court gave Mr. Schiavo permission to remove his wife's feeding tube after a monthlong trial in which Mr. Schiavo and two of his relatives testified that on several occasions, Schiavo had told them she would not want to be kept alive artificially. </s> Later, state lawyers appeared before Judge George W. Greer of Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Court, who ordered Schiavo's feeding tube removed last week, and asked for the second time in a month to intervene in the case. </s> Terri Schiavo died on Thursday 31 March, thirteen days after her feeding tube was removed by court order. </s> Terri Schiavo died 13 days after her feeding tube was removed by order of a Florida state court judge. </s> He became the 47th protester arrested since the feeding tube was removed March 18.
Florida lawmakers refused to intervene in her case. </s> As expected, Florida lawmakers refused to intervene Wednesday in the case of severely brain-damaged Terri Schiavo, despite eleventh-hour lobbying by her brother and mounting pressure from Christian conservatives and anti-abortion groups. </s> "Not only has Mrs. Schiavo's case been given due process, but few, if any similar cases have ever been afforded this heightened level of process," Chief Judge Chris Altenbernd, of the 2nd Court of Appeal in Florida, wrote earlier this month. </s> Florida lawmakers refused to re-enter the case after the federal ruling.
In the final two weeks of Schiavo's life, at least 47 protestors were arrested and there were numerous appeals to have the tube reinserted. </s> However the parents' appeals for reinsertion of the feeding tube were denied. </s> The full US 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, Georgia, refused on Wednesday to reconsider a request to reinsert the feeding tube to a brain-damaged woman in Florida, dealing another blow to hopes of her parents to keep her alive. </s> The Schindlers' lawyers also were asking a federal judge in Tampa, who had ruled against them earlier this week, to consider additional legal arguments. </s> The parents appealed to a three-judge federal appeals panel but were rebuffed. </s> An appeals court and US Circuit court also ruled against her family. </s> The courts have rejected requests by the Schindlers to block Michael Schiavo from having her cremated. </s> A federal judge refused to order Terri Schiavo's feeding tube reinserted Tuesday, and as their legal options dwindled her stunned parents quickly appealed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which gave no hint when it would rule. </s> Despite a predawn federal appeals court ruling that rejected efforts to restore nutrition to Terri Schiavo, Gov. Jeb Bush succeeded on Wednesday in getting a state court to hear new motions in her case, presenting an affidavit from a neurologist who said Schiavo's condition appeared less severe than previously thought.
Wilson was a critic of the Bush administration. </s> Columnist Robert Novak first revealed Plame, whose husband, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson had contradicted one of President Bush's justifications for war against Iraq. </s> Vice President Cheney's chief of staff discussed with New York Times correspondent Judith Miller the fact that the wife of a White House critic worked for the CIA on as many as three occasions before the woman, Valerie Plame, was publicly identified, according to a Times account published Sunday. </s> Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald is investigating who leaked to the press that Valerie Plame, wife of former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, was an undercover CIA agent. </s> Wilson, Plame's husband, went public on July 6, 2003, with criticism of Bush administration officials, suggesting they manipulated intelligence to justify the Iraq war.
