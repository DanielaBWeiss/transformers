The program succeeded in lowering the growth rate from 2.4 percent to 2.1 percent in the first half of 1994. </s> Yet, the serious economic disadvantages to nations and individuals of over-population have driven Islamic Iran, Egypt, Albania, Tunisia (which abolished polygamy), and largely Catholic Spain, Italy, Mexico, Brazil and other Latin American countries to remove government subsidies encouraging large families, start family planning (particularly contraception); women's health and education; and women's emancipation and employment efforts, to reduce fertility rates, as have the U.K., Germany, India, China, Mauritius, the Philippines, Zimbabwe and Botswana. </s> Catholic countries with large populations and high birth rates such as Brazil, Mexico, and the Philippines are beginning to see slowing in birth rates.

A government program and contraception access is starting to slow Iran's rate. </s> The fertility rate in Iran has dropped significantly due to a government program for population control.
The major factors affecting lower growth rates around the world are: increased literacy rights granted to women, family planning programs, and higher employment. </s> Yet, the serious economic disadvantages to nations and individuals of over-population have driven Islamic Iran, Egypt, Albania, Tunisia (which abolished polygamy), and largely Catholic Spain, Italy, Mexico, Brazil and other Latin American countries to remove government subsidies encouraging large families, start family planning (particularly contraception); women's health and education; and women's emancipation and employment efforts, to reduce fertility rates, as have the U.K., Germany, India, China, Mauritius, the Philippines, Zimbabwe and Botswana.
The poor and Catholic Philippines continues with a high rate, which the government is just beginning to address.. </s> However, growth rates in Mexico and the Philippines remain high at 2.4% Africa's growth rate of 2.9% is the highest in the world.
Birth rates in Latin American countries have fallen dramatically, with growth rates under 2%. </s> A sharp slowdown has also occurred in Brazil and other Latin American countries.
The lessening demand for tin has resulted in many changes in Southeast Asian countries, especially in Malaysia. </s> Tin mining in south-east Asia has been steadily declining because of rising production costs and record low tin prices.
Factors leading to tin mining decline include: depleted high-grade tin reserves and high production costs outside Indonesia, Vietnam, China, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, and Portugal; labor shortages and rising wages; Russia becoming a net tin exporter; tin market arbitrage; a strong Malaysian currency against the U.S. dollar; glass, aluminum and plastic packaging; thinner tin coatings on steel cans; and decreased tin-lead solder use. </s> Prices for tin fell dramatically and tin mining operations, particularly those involved in high cost hard rock mining, were forced to close down or cut back operation. </s> Tin mining in south-east Asia has been steadily declining because of rising production costs and record low tin prices.

Tin mining was a centuries old tradition in the country. </s> Tin is part of the country's history: In the 19th century, hundreds of thousands of immigrants from China originally came to the country to work the tin mines. </s> Tin mining had been going on in Malaysia for centuries.
In the 1960s, Malaysia was producing between 60,000 and 70,000 tons of tin annually and employing over 200,000 workers in the industry. </s> After World War II, when the Japanese closed and flooded some mines, production resumed with Malaysian production in 1960 between 60,000 and 70,000 tons.
Meanwhile, Malaysia has moved away from commodity production and put its capital in modern technologies, electronics, tourism, and real estate. </s> High wages and the rapid growth of other industries pushed tin off that nation's priority list.
In the mid-1980s 40,000 workers produced 60,000 tons of tin in Malaysia. </s> By the early 1980s, Malaysia was producing 60,000 tons of tin in concentrate per year while earning between M Dollars 32 and M Dollars 34 kilogram for tin exports. </s> In the early 1980s, Malaysia was producing more than 60,000 tons of tin a year.
The uses of tin have also been declining: aluminum now has the biggest share of the market for beverage cans and the use of tin in solders has been buoyant. </s> Factors leading to tin mining decline include: depleted high-grade tin reserves and high production costs outside Indonesia, Vietnam, China, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, and Portugal; labor shortages and rising wages; Russia becoming a net tin exporter; tin market arbitrage; a strong Malaysian currency against the U.S. dollar; glass, aluminum and plastic packaging; thinner tin coatings on steel cans; and decreased tin-lead solder use.

Several factors explain the slump: the 1985 buffer stock operations collapse leaving 100,000 tons of stockpiled tin on the market; China's export emergence and the Soviet Union's absence from the import market; the US Defense Logistics Agency's selling of tin from stockpiles and the increasing use of aluminum. </s> Historic Southeast Asian tin producers (Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand) were members of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC), which kept prices supported until 1985 when turmoil struck the industry. </s> In 1985 the International Tin Council stopped price supports and dumped 100,000 tons of tin, crushing prices. </s> Tin producers suffered a worldwide crisis in 1985. </s> Beginning in 1985 too much tin had been stockpiled in many countries in the world and was released on the market.
By 1993 China and Brazil were major tin producers and, as non-members of the ATCP, were stockpiling and exporting vast amounts of tin, driving the price down. </s> The failure of the ATPC to enforce production quotas, increased production by non- ATPC members such as China and Brazil as well as the entry of new producers Peru, Portugal, and Vietnam, and the US Defense Logistics Agency disposing of large amounts of tin, all served to undermine the tin industry in Southeast Asia. </s> But Brazil and China were not members.
The collapse of the former Soviet Union, once a substantial consumer of tin, added to the producers' difficulties. </s> Several factors explain the slump: the 1985 buffer stock operations collapse leaving 100,000 tons of stockpiled tin on the market; China's export emergence and the Soviet Union's absence from the import market; the US Defense Logistics Agency's selling of tin from stockpiles and the increasing use of aluminum. </s> The Soviet-bloc had been a big importer.

Indonesia, China and Brazil are now bigger tin producers than Malaysia. </s> Low cost mines in Indonesia, Brazil, and China outsold Malaysia, raising surpluses and lowering prices.
Prices began dropping soon thereafter and efforts by the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) to limit production to boost prices were unsuccessful. </s> Quotas on tin exports introduced by the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) did not have much effect on pricing. </s> Historic Southeast Asian tin producers (Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand) were members of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC), which kept prices supported until 1985 when turmoil struck the industry.
