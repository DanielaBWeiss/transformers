Sentence 1: Tin mining was a centuries old tradition in the country. Sentence 2: Tin mining had been going on in Malaysia for centuries. Sentence 3: Tin is part of the country's history: In the 19th century, hundreds of thousands of immigrants from China originally came to the country to work the tin mines.
Sentence 1: By 1900, it was producing 50,000 tons annually, over half the world's output. Sentence 2: For example, 50,000 tons of tin were produced in Malay in 1900.
Sentence 1: In the 1960s, Malaysia was producing between 60,000 and 70,000 tons of tin annually and employing over 200,000 workers in the industry.

Sentence 1: By 1993 China and Brazil were major tin producers and, as non-members of the ATCP, were stockpiling and exporting vast amounts of tin, driving the price down. Sentence 2: The failure of the ATPC to enforce production quotas, increased production by non- ATPC members such as China and Brazil as well as the entry of new producers Peru, Portugal, and Vietnam, and the US Defense Logistics Agency disposing of large amounts of tin, all served to undermine the tin industry in Southeast Asia. Sentence 3: But Brazil and China were not members.
Sentence 1: Vietnam and Laos also became tin producers. Sentence 2: The failure of the ATPC to enforce production quotas, increased production by non- ATPC members such as China and Brazil as well as the entry of new producers Peru, Portugal, and Vietnam, and the US Defense Logistics Agency disposing of large amounts of tin, all served to undermine the tin industry in Southeast Asia. Sentence 3: Vietnam and Laos are also exporting tin. Sentence 4: Vietnam had entered the tin market, but Portugal and Peru were also exporters.
Sentence 1: Several factors explain the slump: the 1985 buffer stock operations collapse leaving 100,000 tons of stockpiled tin on the market; China's export emergence and the Soviet Union's absence from the import market; the US Defense Logistics Agency's selling of tin from stockpiles and the increasing use of aluminum.

Sentence 1: It develops every several years and works in reverse of El Nino. Sentence 2: El Nino and El Nina are opposite extremes of continuous but far ranging changes in water surface temperature, precipitation, trade winds, and sea level in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, which portend extreme changes and reversals in usual global climate and weather patterns, resulting in dangerous temperature changes, storms, floods and droughts world wide, with severe economic impacts, disease and death.

Sentence 1: Until recently, it was the only treatment for hepatitis but now there is a new treatment approach involving combinations of interferon and ribavirin. Sentence 2: For many years, Interferon was the only approved drug for the treatment of hepatitis C. Its long-term effectiveness was from 20-40% for patients treated for six months.
Sentence 1: A more effective treatment for hepatitis C was to use the drug ribavarin in combination with Interferon. Sentence 2: Studies show that after six months all signs of the virus were gone in 82 percent of those on the combination compared with half on interferon alone. Sentence 3: A frequent hepatitis C treatment is by Rebetron, a combination of interferon injections and ribavirin capsules, which eliminates hepatitis C symptoms in twice as many patients as interferon alone.

Sentence 2: The Department of Justice appealed that decision and in June 1998 the Supreme Court ruled the LIV act unconstitutional but on the grounds that it violated Article I, 7, Clause 2 (The "presentment clause") of the Constitution that establishes the process by which a bill becomes law.
