Sentence 5: Elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa growth rates remain high, while AIDS cuts growth only 1%.
Sentence 1: By 1994, the birthrate plummeted in eastern Germany and the former Soviet Union because of insecurity and the end of Communist subsidies to families. Sentence 2: Eastern Germany's fertility rate has plummeted to .8, mainly due to the change in economics and the new-found freedom to travel. Sentence 3: Yet, the serious economic disadvantages to nations and individuals of over-population have driven Islamic Iran, Egypt, Albania, Tunisia (which abolished polygamy), and largely Catholic Spain, Italy, Mexico, Brazil and other Latin American countries to remove government subsidies encouraging large families, start family planning (particularly contraception); women's health and education; and women's emancipation and employment efforts, to reduce fertility rates, as have the U.K., Germany, India, China, Mauritius, the Philippines, Zimbabwe and Botswana.

Sentence 1: In the coming years, industrialized countries can expect slow growth at a rate of 1% in North America,.5% in the former Soviet Union, and .3% in Europe. Sentence 2: Western Europeans countries are experiencing a "baby bust" with extremely low birth rates in all countries except Ireland and Poland. Sentence 3: The low birth rates in these countries and in Western Europe have slowed world population growth. Sentence 4: The growth rate in American is about 1 percent a year, 0.5 percent in Russia, and 0.3 percent in Western Europe.
Sentence 1: China's "one child" policy has kept population growth down to the same 1.9% as in western Europe. Sentence 2: The policy has had a dramatic effect, with the fertility rate falling to around 1.9 from 2.25 by 1994.

Sentence 2: Prices and consumption began to decline while countries in other areas of the world increased production.
Sentence 1: Prices are also declining because materials like glass, aluminum, and plastic are replacing tin in the packaging industry. Sentence 2: Furthermore, the demand for tin for use in food storage was being replaced by glass, aluminum, and plastic. Sentence 3: Also glass, aluminum, and plastic began replacing tin as containers and the tin coating on tin-plated steel cans became thinner. Sentence 4: Factors leading to tin mining decline include: depleted high-grade tin reserves and high production costs outside Indonesia, Vietnam, China, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, and Portugal; labor shortages and rising wages; Russia becoming a net tin exporter; tin market arbitrage; a strong Malaysian currency against the U.S. dollar; glass, aluminum and plastic packaging; thinner tin coatings on steel cans; and decreased tin-lead solder use.

Sentence 6: With the discovery of rich tin deposits in 1857, Malaysia gradually became the leading producer of tin in the world.
Sentence 1: Many Chinese immigrants came to work in the mines. Sentence 2: Tin is part of the country's history: In the 19th century, hundreds of thousands of immigrants from China originally came to the country to work the tin mines. Sentence 3: In the late 1800's, Chinese immigrants flooded in to work the mines. Sentence 4: In 1857 rich deposits were found on the Malay Peninsula and the industry flourished with British concessions and thousands of Chinese immigrant workers. Sentence 5: Thousands of Chinese immigrated into that country to work in the mines. Sentence 6: The British initially developed the industry, employing hundreds of thousands of Chinese immigrants.
Sentence 1: It survived hardships during WW II, and reopened after the end of the war. Sentence 2: After World War II, when the Japanese closed and flooded some mines, production resumed with Malaysian production in 1960 between 60,000 and 70,000 tons.

Sentence 1: Meanwhile, Malaysia has moved away from commodity production and put its capital in modern technologies, electronics, tourism, and real estate. Sentence 2: High wages and the rapid growth of other industries pushed tin off that nation's priority list.
Sentence 1: Prices began dropping soon thereafter and efforts by the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) to limit production to boost prices were unsuccessful. Sentence 2: Prices and consumption began to decline while countries in other areas of the world increased production. Sentence 3: The world wide tin market experienced decreasing prices for that commodity in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Sentence 4: However, low tin prices forced most of Malaysia's tin miners to give up the struggle. Sentence 5: Prices for tin fell dramatically and tin mining operations, particularly those involved in high cost hard rock mining, were forced to close down or cut back operation.

Sentence 1: It now has risen to top place among the world's producers behind China. Sentence 2: China, now the world's largest tin producer, joined the ATPC in 1993, giving other producing countries hope that China would curb its overproduction, but that country continued to pump large quantities of the metal into export markets. Sentence 3: Indonesia was the world's top producer in 1991, but by 1994 China and Brazil had the lead.
Sentence 1: Vietnam and Laos are also exporting tin. Sentence 2: Vietnam and Laos also became tin producers.

Sentence 1: The U.S. continued selling its "substantial" tin stockpiles, while U.K. warehouses brimmed with tin. Sentence 2: Also by 1993 the United States Defense Logistics Agency had begun selling off its stockpiles. Sentence 3: The failure of the ATPC to enforce production quotas, increased production by non- ATPC members such as China and Brazil as well as the entry of new producers Peru, Portugal, and Vietnam, and the US Defense Logistics Agency disposing of large amounts of tin, all served to undermine the tin industry in Southeast Asia. Sentence 4: Several factors explain the slump: the 1985 buffer stock operations collapse leaving 100,000 tons of stockpiled tin on the market; China's export emergence and the Soviet Union's absence from the import market; the US Defense Logistics Agency's selling of tin from stockpiles and the increasing use of aluminum.
