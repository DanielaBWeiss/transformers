Sentence 1: In most cases, the patient is comatose or mentally unable to communicate his/her feelings and the decision to remove the life-support system is made by relatives in agreement with hospital administrators or upon authority of a local judge. Sentence 2: Often, court orders are required to have this done.
Sentence 1: Deforestation is the greatest problem for the rainforest environment and is brought about by logging for valuable hardwood timber, by land stripping for farming and cattle raising, and by road building for access to mining and oil exploration areas. Sentence 2: Environmentalists were becoming increasingly concerned about the destruction of the Amazon rainforest during the 1880s. Sentence 3: Deforestation of the Amazon rain forest causes a number of serious environmental problems. Sentence 4: The Amazon rain forest was heavily damaged by deforestation from increasing logging, cattle ranching, farming, mining, roadways, and hydroelectric projects.
Sentence 1: The mountains of Columbia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia face erosion and silting; a crush of oil-rush settlers; illegal cocoa fields with their herbicide and chemical run-offs; the threatened spread of cocoa plantations throughout the entire Amazon basin; and deforestation from out-dated settlement incentives in a hodgepodge of policies and contradictory laws.

Sentence 3: Illegal coca fields and cocaine processing in the cleared land also pollutes rivers with illegal chemicals. Sentence 4: Coca growers' herbicides and refining chemicals wash into rivers.
Sentence 1: Financial incentives for forest removal were ended and burnings outlawed. Sentence 2: Brazilian programs to reduce deforestation and CO2 emission, and promote sustainable development include "extractive reserves" which globally market renewable "rain-forest chic" products (replenishable trees, produce, nuts, latex, pharmaceutical plants); discontinuing subsidies to clear-cutting for unsustainable ranches which dislocated forest people; tree improvement; pesticide controls; minimizing roads and mineral mining impacts; increasing fish pond farming; and improving law enforcement. Sentence 3: In order to preserve the rainforest, Brazil ended subsidies to ranchers for forest clearance, and made a law prohibiting landowners from clearing more that 50% of their property. Sentence 4: Subsidies for ranchers are being removed and timber policies made more restrictive.
Sentence 1: Accompanying the reserves are projects for education, technical aid, and financing to help people preserve the forest while benefiting from its riches. Sentence 2: Efforts are underway to teach farmers proper harvesting techniques and wean them from the slash and burn cycle.

Sentence 1: Thin-strip casting was expected to produce higher quality than thin-slab. Sentence 2: Still another new technology is strip casting which US Steel may invest in and is expected to produce a superior quality of steel. Sentence 3: Some other new technologies for steel production include using a hot rolling mill to produce thin strip casting, which US Steel believes produces a higher quality product, and using electric arc furnaces to replace the old coal-fired equipment.

Sentence 1: By the year 2050, the world population is expected to double from 5.7 bn to some 10.6 bn. Sentence 2: United Nations population projections in 1993 were for the world population to double from the current 5.5 billion to 11 billion by 2050. Sentence 3: Population Fund report projects that by 2050 the world population will have grown from 1994's 5.7 billion to stabilize at 10 billion (if population growth rates continue to decline as expected), 7.8 billion (if rates decline even just a little faster than expected) or 12.5 billion (if today's rates stop falling). Sentence 4: That is double the present 5.5 billion.
Sentence 1: Moslem countries such as Indonesia, Iran, Egypt and especially, Tunisia have slowed birth rates. Sentence 2: A government program and contraception access is starting to slow Iran's rate. Sentence 3: Iran's clerics, who initially encouraged large families, now encourage family planning, which has dropped their growth rate from 3.9% to 2.3%. Sentence 4: The fertility rate in Iran has dropped significantly due to a government program for population control.
Sentence 1: A sharp slowdown has also occurred in Brazil and other Latin American countries.

Sentence 4: The policy has had a dramatic effect, with the fertility rate falling to around 1.9 from 2.25 by 1994.
Sentence 1: Tin mining in south-east Asia has been steadily declining because of rising production costs and record low tin prices. Sentence 2: The lessening demand for tin has resulted in many changes in Southeast Asian countries, especially in Malaysia.

Sentence 1: From before 1992 through 1994 the UK's Tory Prime Minister adamantly resisted calls by MPs of the miniscule Wales Nationalist Party (Plaid Cymru) for devolution of British rule to a fully self-governing Wales within the European Community. Sentence 2: Those who speak the language support Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party whose policy is to bypass an assembly and go for an independent Wales within the European community. Sentence 3: Plaid Cymru wants full independence with a Welsh parliament. Sentence 4: Conservatives were strongly opposed, and the policy of Plaid Cymru, the nationalist party, was to bypass an assembly and go directly for independence within the European community.

Sentence 2: Single-sex education appears to have definite advantages for girls. Sentence 3: Even though research shows that single-sex education is beneficial for girls, the few women's colleges in the U.S. are struggling. Sentence 4: Single-sex education is superior for girls.
Sentence 1: Both girls and boys can forge close friendships and camaraderie in single sex institutions. Sentence 2: A minor concern would be that the camaraderie boys enjoy in singe-sex schools would be lost in coed schools, once they begin competing for the attentions of female classmates.
Sentence 1: Another advantage is that students get accustomed to working with the other gender, a more natural situation and one that will be experienced in the workforce. Sentence 2: Many supporters of co-ed schools do so because it is more like the real world environment where both sexes mingle.
Sentence 1: In the United Kingdom single-sex schools are the ones performing better academically with only one school in the top 30 being coeducational before the age of 16. Sentence 2: In 1992-1994, UK testing of school performance showed that "a disproportionate share of the best schools, academically, are single-sex," both public and private (sectarian or secular). Sentence 3: Generally speaking, single-sex schools have tended to produce higher levels of academic achievement. Sentence 4: Ratings of schools by the Financial Times of London consistently show that single-sex schools rate higher academically.
Sentence 1: Educators believe that girls flourish in classrooms without boys, who tend to be less mature, and benefit from having fewer distractions.
