Writing in the latest issue of the journal "Geology," British scientists said a survey had shown that ice shelves had retreated thousands of years ago as a result of rising air and ocean temperatures. </s> Measuring some 3,250 square kilometers (1,250 sq. miles) in area and 220 metres (715 feet) thick, the Larsen B iceshelf broke away from the eastern Antarctic Peninsula in 2002, eventually disintegrating into giant icebergs. </s> The collapse of a huge ice shelf in Antarctica in 2002 has no precedent in the past 11,000 years, according to a study to be published on Thursday that points the finger at global warming. </s> The current retreat of ice shelves in the Antarctic due to global warming is nothing new _ but this time the problem is manmade and therefore potentially more serious, according to research released Wednesday. </s> The gradual removal of this ice shelf may be causing the glaciers inland to flow faster, which could lead to enhanced drainage of part of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and a rise in sea level. </s> There aren't sufficient data," said Argentina's Pedro Skvarca, a veteran Antarctic glaciologist. </s> The hypotheses scientists offer for the causes of glacier and ice shelf thinning in Antarctica are varied. </s> Now that one mammoth Antarctic ice shelf has collapsed into the ocean, when might another, bigger one crumble and slip into a warming sea?
The gradual removal of this ice shelf may be causing the glaciers inland to flow faster, which could lead to enhanced drainage of part of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and a rise in sea level. </s> And "the deeper the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, the greater the potential impact to sea level," Casassa pointed out, though cautioning that their data awaits full analysis.
Other topics are the environmental impact of increasing tourism in the Antarctic. </s> Other tour operators also report a surge of interest in travel within the Arctic Circle.
The study is particularly relevant for other surveys on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet where scientists have found that a relatively warm current, Circumpolar Deep Water, is causing high melt rates on the underside of an ice shelf in Pine Island Bay. </s> The gradual removal of this ice shelf may be causing the glaciers inland to flow faster, which could lead to enhanced drainage of part of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and a rise in sea level.
Since satellite observations began in earnest, researchers said Arctic ice has been retreating at a rate of more than 8 percent per decade. </s> New satellite observations show that sea ice in the Arctic is melting faster while air temperatures in the region are rising sharply, scientists say. </s> That's the lowest measurement of Arctic sea ice cover ever recorded, the researchers said. </s> The rate of ice melting in the Arctic is increasing and a panel of researchers says it sees no natural process that is likely to change that trend.
The Arctic's atmosphere is warming twice as fast as elsewhere on earth, and experts have warned that the region's ice could melt away completely by the end of this century, endangering many animal species and the traditional lifestyle of Inuits and Lapplanders. </s> Within a century the melting could lead to summertime ice-free ocean conditions not seen in the area in a million years, the group said Tuesday.
Two of Greenland's largest glaciers are retreating at an alarming pace, most likely because of climate warming, scientists said Wednesday. </s> The rapid retreat of Greenland glaciers suggest that climate change is a factor, Hamilton said. </s> The Sermilik glacier in southern Greenland has retreated 11 kilometers (6.84 miles), and the Sermeq Kujalleq glacier near Ilulissat also is moving at a faster pace, said Henrik Hoejmark Thomsen of the geological survey. </s> Watching the gargantuan chunks of ice break off the Sermeq Kujalleq glacier and thunder into an Arctic fjord is a spectacular sight.
For example, the white sea ice reflects solar radiation back into space, but as the ice melts the dark water will absorb some of the light, warming and melting more ice. </s> Current projections in climate models suggest that global warming during the next century or two will cause thermal expansion of water and some melting of glacial ice chiefly in Greenland.

Jeb Bush to defy the courts and intervene. </s> On Wednesday night, the Supreme Court refused, for the sixth time, to intervene in the matter.
The state immediately appealed to the Florida Supreme Court, which refused to overrule Greer. </s> But he also said that under the new law passed by Congress, the federal court should "not unduly trouble itself with the history" of the case in state court. </s> The hearing on Monday was the result of a determined effort by the Republican leadership in Congress to override a series of state court rulings that sided with Schiavo's husband, Michael. </s> "Not only has Mrs. Schiavo's case been given due process, but few, if any similar cases have ever been afforded this heightened level of process," Chief Judge Chris Altenbernd, of the 2nd Court of Appeal in Florida, wrote earlier this month. </s> The legislature rushed through a law empowering Gov. Bush to order the tube reinserted, overriding years of court rulings and infuriating Mr. Schiavo, who sued on grounds that the measure was unconstitutional. </s> The Florida Supreme Court agreed with him and knocked down the law, but it prolonged the case, and Schiavo's life, for well over a year. </s> George J. Felos, the lawyer for Terri's husband, said Michael Schiavo was saddened by the protracted legal maneuvering but "very grateful" for Thursday's court action. </s> Terri Schiavo, the severely brain damaged Florida woman who became the subject of an intense legal and political battle that drew responses from the White House to the Halls of Congress to the Vatican, died Thursday, 13 days after her feeding tube was removed on the order of a state court judge. </s> During the hearing in Tampa, the chief lawyer for Schiavo's parents, Robert and Mary Schindler, told Whittemore that Schiavo's due process rights had been violated because she had not had independent legal representation during the seven years the case was in state courts.

Raines, the chairman and chief executive of Fannie Mae, is expected to tell lawmakers on Wednesday that his company properly applied accounting principles and never took steps to manipulate earnings or shade financial statements to enable top executives to receive large bonuses. </s> Testifying before Congress earlier this month, chairman and chief executive Franklin Raines and chief financial officer Timothy Howard said Fannie Mae did nothing wrong in its accounting and insisted that the regulators' allegations represent an arguable interpretation of complex rules. </s> Raines and Howard, testifying at a House hearing last week, insisted that Fannie Mae did nothing wrong in its accounting and insisted that the regulators' allegations represent an arguable interpretation of complex rules. </s> An advance text of his statement was provided to the committee, and in it Raines takes issue with the main conclusions of the report by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which said that Fannie Mae misapplied accounting rules to manipulate earnings and maximize executive bonuses.
And as the Justice Department investigation of Fannie Mae continues, other problems may surface. </s> Then, late last week, amid a mounting tempest of congressional criticism, Fannie Mae became the subject of a criminal investigation by the Justice Department; that investigation is likely to take precedence over a continuing Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry. </s> Fannie faces investigations by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission and litigation by shareholders. </s> Because the SEC backed OFHEO's key findings on Fannie's accounting, the Justice Department will continue its ongoing investigation into whether top Fannie Mae executives manipulated earnings to trigger multimillion-dollar bonuses for themselves, a source said. </s> Fannie Mae's accounting has been under investigation by the Justice Department and the SEC, and it has become the subject of investor lawsuits. </s> Mortgage giant Fannie Mae, gripped by an accounting scandal and under investigation by the Justice Department, disclosed Tuesday that prosecutors had asked the company to preserve documents as part of the criminal probe. </s> The company remains under investigation by the SEC, the Justice Department and OFHEO, which is examining additional accounting issues.
Fannie Mae's accounting has been under investigation by the Justice Department and the SEC, and it has become the subject of investor lawsuits. </s> Fannie faces investigations by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission and litigation by shareholders. </s> In a regulatory filing, the government-sponsored company also reported that it has been informed of eight lawsuits on behalf of shareholders that are being prepared or have been filed against it, chairman and chief executive Franklin Raines and chief financial officer Timothy Howard. </s> Fannie Mae said in its filing with the SEC that the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, which is pursuing the criminal investigation, had asked it to preserve certain documents _ including papers related to a report by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight which alleged earnings manipulation to meet Wall Street expectations and accounting improprieties by the company.

The directors of Fannie Mae, the big mortgage finance company, will meet Sunday to consider the fate of two senior executives who signed off on financial statements that violated accounting rules, people close to the company said Friday. </s> US mortgage finance giant Fannie Mae, found guilty of violating accounting rules and accused of paying dizzying bonuses to its bosses, has made public the entitlements and compensation claimed by its departing chief executive and finance director. </s> Finally, the Securities and Exchange Commission concluded that Fannie Mae, where Raines is chairman and chief executive, had engaged in questionable accounting practices over the past four years -- practices that Raines stubbornly defended even after serious questions had been raised. </s> Both executives certified financial statements that the Securities and Exchange Commission have ordered revised because of violations of accounting rules. </s> Now the chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission has ruled that the report was right and that Fannie had violated accounting standards, overstating its profit by 38 percent since January 2001.
He said the directors acted quickly and appropriately when its regulator, OFHEO, made the findings of its investigation public. </s> Fannie's federal regulator, however, demanded management changes, holding Raines responsible for a corporate culture that emphasized stable earnings at the expense of accurate financial disclosures. </s> They appear to have done so only under duress from Fannie's chief regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which in September put the company on notice that its improper accounting had vastly overstated profits and misrepresented its financial position. </s> Fannie Mae's regulator -- the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight -- alleged in September that the company made errors.
The report said that Fannie Mae delayed booking $200 million of expenses in 1998, which allowed Raines and other top executives to receive millions of dollars in bonuses linked to Fannie's profit. </s> US mortgage finance giant Fannie Mae, found guilty of violating accounting rules and accused of paying dizzying bonuses to its bosses, has made public the entitlements and compensation claimed by its departing chief executive and finance director. </s> In a document delivered to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Fannie Mae also acknowledged having received a letter from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), informing the company of its investigation into pay and bonuses of former chief executive Franklin Raines and of former finance director Timothy Howard, both of whom were sacked on December 21.
Tough consequences will follow: The Justice Department is pursuing a criminal investigation; the SEC is pursuing a civil one; the House promises hearings; and class-action lawsuits are in the works. </s> The Washington D.C.-based housing finance company, which stands behind or owns a quarter of the nation's mortgages, faces a criminal investigation by the Justice Department; a civil investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission; an ongoing probe of other accounting issues by its main regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight; and class-action lawsuits by investors.
Fannie's federal regulator, however, demanded management changes, holding Raines responsible for a corporate culture that emphasized stable earnings at the expense of accurate financial disclosures. </s> They appear to have done so only under duress from Fannie's chief regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which in September put the company on notice that its improper accounting had vastly overstated profits and misrepresented its financial position.
Franklin Raines stepped down Tuesday as chairman and chief executive of Fannie Mae, as the company's directors ended days of tense and emotional deliberations and bowed to pressure from regulators who wanted him out. </s> In a document delivered to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Fannie Mae also acknowledged having received a letter from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), informing the company of its investigation into pay and bonuses of former chief executive Franklin Raines and of former finance director Timothy Howard, both of whom were sacked on December 21. </s> Fannie Mae's chief executive, Franklin Raines, and its top financial officer, Timothy Howard, were forced out last month after revelations that the company will have to restate some $9 billion (euro6.9 billion) in earnings, or about one-third of its profits, dating to 2001. </s> Fannie Mae also named another executive, Robert Levin, as its interim chief financial officer, to succeed J. Timothy Howard, who, like Raines, was forced out Tuesday.
They are grappling with whether the newly found celestial body, known for now as 2003 UB313, should be granted planetary status, and if it is not, whether Pluto, a like-size ice ball in a far orbit of the sun, should be stripped of the title. </s> A US astronomer announced Friday he had discovered what could be a 10th planet in the outer reaches of the solar system nearly 15 billion kilometers (nine billion miles) from earth. </s> The planet 2003 UB313 has since been observed with a variety of other telescopes.
"If Pluto is a planet, then anything larger than Pluto is a planet, and this is definitely larger than Pluto," said Caltech astronomer Michael A. Brown, who announced the discovery at anews conference Friday. </s> Astronomers announced Friday that they have found a lump of rock and ice that is larger than Pluto and the farthest known object in the solar system. </s> Astronomers at the California Institute of Technology have discovered what they believe is the tenth and most distant planet in our solar system, a ball of rock that is about twice as big as Pluto and about three times as far out. </s> The astronomers do not have an exact size for the new planet, but its brightness and distance tell them that it is larger than Pluto, the smallest of the nine known planets. </s> "It is guaranteed bigger than Pluto," said Michael E. Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at Caltech and a member of the team that made the discovery.
The astronomers who claim to have discovered the 10th planet in the solar system have made another intriguing announcement: it has a moon. </s> Brown said he expected to find a moon orbiting Xena because many Kuiper Belt objects are paired with moons.
Astronomers have long debated whether Pluto is a planet because of its small size and odd orbit, although many scientists are content to retain its current designation. </s> Try as they might, scientists could not come up with a definition that would retain Pluto as a planet without requiring that scads of other objects be deemed planets as well. </s> Pluto, with its elongated orbit and odd orbital plane, seems to behave more like other Kuiper Belt objects than other planets, some astronomers say. </s> When a Caltech astronomer, Michael Brown, announced last year that his team had found a distant object three-fourths the size of Pluto orbiting the sun, he declined to call it a planet, and he even suggested that Pluto should not be considered a planet either. </s> But Brown conceded that the discovery would likely rekindle debate over the definition of "planet" and whether Pluto should still be regarded as one. </s> In its exhibition hall, eight planets are prominently displayed, and the supposed ninth, Pluto, rates only a plaque, casting doubt on its status as a planet.
Pluto, with its elongated orbit and odd orbital plane, seems to behave more like other Kuiper Belt objects than other planets, some astronomers say. </s> They are grappling with whether the newly found celestial body, known for now as 2003 UB313, should be granted planetary status, and if it is not, whether Pluto, a like-size ice ball in a far orbit of the sun, should be stripped of the title. </s> Perhaps Pluto, small, distant and poorly observed, should be downgraded from true planet to a mere Kuiper Belt Object, or KBO, one of the thousands of icy bodies orbiting beyond Neptune that probably are leftovers from the creation of the outer solar system.
At the time it was the brightest and largest object -- next to Pluto -- yet found in the Kuiper belt, a ring of debris that stretches out beyond Neptune. </s> In July, Brown announced the discovery of an icy, rocky object larger than Pluto in the Kuiper Belt, a disc of icy bodies beyond Neptune. </s> Tyson provocatively removed Pluto from his exhibit of planets five years ago, lumping it instead with a belt of comets at the edge of the solar system.
There was still no good scientific rationale for the judgment, he admitted, but this was a case where habit -- 75 years of calling Pluto a planet -- should trump any scientific definition. </s> But the newly discovered moon, nicknamed Gabrielle after Xena's faithful traveling sidekick in the TV series, likely will not quell the debate over what exactly is a planet and whether Pluto should keep its status. </s> Pluto was quickly heralded as the ninth planet in the solar system when it was spotted Feb. 18, 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh, a young amateur astronomer at Lowell Observatory. </s> If confirmed, the discovery by Professor Mike Brown of the respected California Institute of Technology would be the first of a planet since Pluto was identified in 1930. </s> Pluto, the most recently discovered planet, is so tightly woven into astrological charts, to lose it would be unthinkable, Oswald said. </s> Astronomers have long argued over whether Pluto should be called a planet and speculated that ice balls larger than Pluto might be hiding in the Kuiper Belt, a ring of debris beyond the orbit of Neptune.
Last month, when scientists announced the discovery of a possible 10th planet, some 9 billion miles from the sun, they reignited a long-running debate about what a true planet is. </s> But Brown conceded that the discovery would likely rekindle debate over the definition of "planet" and whether Pluto should still be regarded as one. </s> The discovery will likely rekindle debate over the definition of "planet" and whether Pluto still merits the designation. </s> But the newly discovered moon, nicknamed Gabrielle after Xena's faithful traveling sidekick in the TV series, likely will not quell the debate over what exactly is a planet and whether Pluto should keep its status.
The most distant planet from the sun, Pluto is only about 1,475 miles in diameter, or two-thirds the size of earth's moon -- so tiny that some scientists question whether it qualifies for planethood at all. </s> Like Pluto, which has a diameter of 1,400 miles, 2003 UB313 is a member of the Kuiper Belt, a ring of icy debris that orbits beyond Neptune.
The finding definitively makes the icy ball -- temporarily labeled 2003 UB313 and nicknamed Xena -- the largest known object to be discovered orbiting Earth's sun since Neptune was identified in 1846, and adds to the debate over what should be considered a planet. </s> The discovery of 2003 UB313 has intensified a debate over the definition of a planet, which has swirled about Pluto since the late 1990s.
Bertoldi said he preferred to keep Pluto as a planet and to bestow planethood on 2003 UB313. </s> Marsden says he thinks that both Pluto and Brown's Xena should be called minor planets. </s> One school agrees with Bertoldi that the Pluto tradition should be upheld, but another suggests that Pluto, 2003 UB313 and other icy denizens of the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune are not planets but "objects."
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili, who took office in January, has vowed to reunify the country by bringing South Ossetia and Abkhazia back under Tbilisi's control. </s> Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili said Wednesday he would present official proposals to separatist territories Abkhazia and South Ossetia by the end of this month, hoping that the people -- if not the Russian-backed self-proclaimed governments -- will listen. </s> Tensions have escalated between Tbilisi and the two provinces _ as well as Russia _ after Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili vowed to bring the regions back under central control. </s> Having easily swept to the presidency months later, the 36-year-old US-educated lawyer faced a massive challenge -- widespread corruption, separatism and economic and social decay had turned one of the richest regions in the Soviet Union into a massive challenge.
Tensions have escalated between Tbilisi and the two provinces _ as well as Russia _ after Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili vowed to bring the regions back under central control. </s> Saakashvili has said he will not rest until Georgia's wayward regions -- South Ossetia and Abkhazia -- are back under Tbilisi's control. </s> After his stunning electoral victory in January with 96 percent of the vote, Saakashvili dismissed several ministers and other senior officials suspected of corruption and declared his intention to end the de facto secession of the pro-Russian regions of Adzharia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. </s> Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili, who took office in January, has vowed to reunify the country by bringing South Ossetia and Abkhazia back under Tbilisi's control. </s> Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili vowed Tuesday to step up preparations to defend Georgia's territorial integrity and restore control over Abkhazia, according to the Interfax.
The United States called Monday for a resumption in talks to end the conflict between Georgia and Abkhazia but made clear it recognized neither the independence of the breakaway Georgian region nor the legitimacy of its weekend elections. </s> Fears of a new conflict have resurfaced though, since Mikhail Saakashvili, a tough-talking US-trained lawyer backed by Washington, was swept to power in Tbilisi late last year in a bloodless revolution.
"The abduction of the Georgian police officers is a provocation by the government of (South Ossetian president) Eduard Kokoity," Kareli said. </s> Two Georgian police officers have been abducted in South Ossetia in what Georgian authorities described Thursday as an attempt to sabotage the peace process with the separatist region.
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili on Tuesday called for a new Yalta conference, a voluntary association of new European democracies whose goal would be to extend the rule of liberty throughout the Black Sea region and beyond. </s> "After recent discussions with Presidents Traian Basescu of Romania and Viktor Yushchenko of Ukraine," Saakashvili said, "I believe it is time for a new Yalta Conference" with three main goals.
Rossi had led the election by just 261 votes after the November 2 vote when 2.9 million voters cast their ballots, leading to an automatic hand recount. </s> The initial count after the Nov. 2 election had the Republican candidate, Dino Rossi, ahead by 261 votes out of 2.9 million cast.
Washington and Alaska, however, require only that ballots be postmarked by Election Day. </s> Washington is one of two states (the other is Alaska) that allow voters to mail ballots on Election Day, so votes have trickled in at an agonizingly slow pace.
A month and a day after voters went to the polls, the closest governor's race in Washington state history -- and one of the nation's closest-ever statewide contests -- lurched forward Friday, as state Democrats announced they had raised enough money to start a third count, this one by hand, of nearly 3 million ballots. </s> The gubernatorial elections in Washington state and the US island of Puerto Rico have finally ended, seven weeks after the close results of their respective elections led to bitter political and legal fights, officials said Friday. </s> Alleging that dead people, felons and other ineligible voters cast ballots in Washington state's tortuously close election for governor, the Republican candidate filed a lawsuit Friday, seeking the extraordinary remedy of a new election. </s> The closest governor's race in Washington history was forced into a recount as counties finished tallying the ballots and found only a few votes separating the candidates out of 2.8 million cast. </s> As political junkies across the country have recovered from their presidential election withdrawal, they have turned to the Washington governor's race for entertainment. </s> New ballots continued to pop up here in King County as the second recount in the race for Washington governor descended into an alphabet soup of intrigue and, in a neighboring county, a judge issued a restraining order preventing King County from counting the newfound ballots. </s> After a bitter and protracted recount fight in the Washington governor's race, elections officials announced Wednesday that the Democratic candidate, Christine O. Gregoire, was leading her Republican opponent by 10 votes -- a minuscule margin but a stunning reversal of the Nov. 2 election results.
Christine O.
