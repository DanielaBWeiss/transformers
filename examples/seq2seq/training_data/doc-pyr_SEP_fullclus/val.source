But scientists also worry about what Thomas calls the "back door" _ a stretch of Antarctic coast whose glaciers feed off the western ice sheet directly into the Amundsen Sea, or into small ice shelves on that sea. </s> With temperatures climbing in parts of Antarctica in recent years, melt water seems to be penetrating deeper and deeper into ice crevices, weakening immense and seemingly impregnable formations that have developed over thousands of years. </s> And "the deeper the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, the greater the potential impact to sea level," Casassa pointed out, though cautioning that their data awaits full analysis.
Global warming also has an impact on infrastructures that are built on permafrost. </s> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a U.N.-organized network of scientists, concluded in a 2001 assessment that the impact of global warming "will be realized slowly" in Antarctica. </s> The collapse of a huge ice shelf in Antarctica in 2002 has no precedent in the past 11,000 years, according to a study to be published on Thursday that points the finger at global warming. </s> The eight-nation Arctic Council said the annual average amount of sea ice around the North Pole has decreased about 8 percent in 30 years because of global warming fueled by greenhouse gas emissions. </s> That study, commissioned by the United States and seven other nations, found permafrost there to be thawing and glaciers and sea ice to be retreating markedly, raising new concerns about global warming and its impact. </s> Leaders of the Arctic region's indigenous people on Friday urged European countries to step up the fight against global warming, saying it is threatening their societies, economies and cultures. </s> The current retreat of ice shelves in the Antarctic due to global warming is nothing new _ but this time the problem is manmade and therefore potentially more serious, according to research released Wednesday.
Last month, U.S. scientists issued a report saying the rate of ice melting in the Arctic is increasing and within a century could lead to summertime ice-free ocean conditions not seen in the area in a million years. </s> Since satellite observations began in earnest, researchers said Arctic ice has been retreating at a rate of more than 8 percent per decade. </s> The frequency and size of the crumbling blocks are a powerful reminder that the ice sheet covering the world's largest island is thinning, which scientists say is one of the most glaring examples of global warming. </s> That's the lowest measurement of Arctic sea ice cover ever recorded, the researchers said. </s> New satellite observations show that sea ice in the Arctic is melting faster while air temperatures in the region are rising sharply, scientists say. </s> Within a century the melting could lead to summertime ice-free ocean conditions not seen in the area in a million years, the group said Tuesday. </s> The rate of ice melting in the Arctic is increasing and a panel of researchers says it sees no natural process that is likely to change that trend.
Two of Greenland's largest glaciers are retreating at an alarming pace, most likely because of climate warming, scientists said Wednesday. </s> The Sermilik glacier in southern Greenland has retreated 11 kilometers (6.84 miles), and the Sermeq Kujalleq glacier near Ilulissat also is moving at a faster pace, said Henrik Hoejmark Thomsen of the geological survey. </s> The rapid retreat of Greenland glaciers suggest that climate change is a factor, Hamilton said.

US and European scientists fear the collapse of ice shelves in Greenland and Antarctica will raise ocean levels faster than estimated, said a report published Friday in the journal Science. </s> The rapid breakdown of the floating ice shelves observed in recent years, the experts said, could destabilize land-based ice sheets and glaciers behind them and cause faster melting and rise in sea levels than anticipated.
Melting permafrost has damaged hundreds of buildings, railway lines, airport runways and gas pipelines in Russia, according to the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, a report commissioned by the Arctic Council and released in 2004. </s> In Russia, 20 percent of which lies above the Arctic Circle, melting of the permafrost threatens the foundations of homes, factories, pipelines.
Official efforts to make mines safer have largely failed because mine owners simply reopen closed pits illegally, critics say. </s> It is the voracious demand that results in so many accidents, with safety procedures ignored in the quest for profits.
Before this bid, the bureau had ordered 8,648 coal mines which failed to renew their work safety certificates to stop operation for safety checks due to the frequent blasts and accidents took place in coal mines throughout the country. </s> Zhao Tiechui, director of the National Bureau of Production Safety Supervision and Administration, revealed on Monday that so far, 12,148 coal mines have been ordered to suspend production for rectification.
Coal mine accidents occur one after another throughout the country. </s> The small coal mines have not only caused grave resource waste, with a low rate of recovery, which is averaged between 10 percent to 15 percent, but also serious pollution and higher incidence of accidents major, posing a long-standing problem endangering safety at coal mines in the country, according to Zhao. </s> Aside from coal mines, China's fatality rate from other industrial accidents was falling, Li said. </s> But, the rate of large-scale accidents is increasing, according to Hong Kong-based China Labor Bulletin. </s> The accident number and death toll saw a year-on-year increase of 18 and 42 percent respectively, highlighting the "severe situation" of the safety management in Shaanxi's coal mining industry, according to the provincial committee of industrial safety. </s> All 17 gas-rich coal mines in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have been installed with advanced automatic gas monitors, in a bid to reverse the trend of increasing fatal accidents.
But the plight of pets in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina did more than just soften the hearts of the nation's animal lovers -- it opened their wallets. </s> To help return pets to their owners, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Humane Society of the United States have established a fund to help pay transportation and other costs, said Karen Medicus, ASPCA project director based in Austin. </s> Animal advocacy groups said the level of giving to pet charities does not mean the donors value pets above people.
As thousands of animals remain stranded in hurricane-ravaged Louisiana, trapped in homes or roaming evacuated streets, the head of the Humane Society complained Friday that authorities have ignored pleas to set a policy for animal rescues. </s> "We want a policy to say that local, state and federal responders should actively assist animal rescue," he said.
If Hurricane Katrina causes Congress to create a government safety net for the nation's pets, Rep. Jim Oberstar says it won't be the first time that a higher power intervened on behalf of animals. </s> Critics say the proposal for pet evacuation goes too far.

In one of the fiercest life- and-death battles in the United States, the state House in Florida passed a bill Thursday to extend life support for a brain-damaged woman. </s> The Florida Legislature passed the so-called "Terri's law" in October 2003, allowing for the reinsertion of the feeding tube after lower courts ruled to remove it. </s> In October 2003, Florida Governor Jeb Bush invoked a law rushed through the state legislature to overrule a court ruling authorizing the removal of the life support for Schiavo. </s> It was the second time the Supreme Court dodged the politically charged case from Florida, where Republican Gov. Jeb Bush successfully lobbied the Legislature to pass a law to keep 41-year-old Terri Schiavo on life support. </s> Eight years later, her husband wanted to remove her feeding tube, setting off years of legal feuding with her parents that has taken both sides from the state and federal courts to the State Legislature to the U.S. Supreme Court, and now to Congress.

Greer of Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Court gave Mr. Schiavo permission to remove his wife's feeding tube after a monthlong trial in which Mr. Schiavo and two of his relatives testified that on several occasions, Schiavo had told them she would not want to be kept alive artificially. </s> Terri Schiavo, the severely brain damaged Florida woman who became the subject of an intense legal and political battle that drew responses from the White House to the Halls of Congress to the Vatican, died Thursday, 13 days after her feeding tube was removed on the order of a state court judge. </s> Later, state lawyers appeared before Judge George W. Greer of Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Court, who ordered Schiavo's feeding tube removed last week, and asked for the second time in a month to intervene in the case. </s> Terri Schiavo's condition deteriorated visibly seven days after her feeding tube was removed by court order. </s> Terri Schiavo's feeding tube was removed March 18 on a court order sought by her husband, Michael Schiavo, who contends she wouldn't want to be kept alive artificially. </s> The case first drew national attention in October 2003, when Greer ordered the tube removed a second time.
"Not only has Mrs. Schiavo's case been given due process, but few, if any similar cases have ever been afforded this heightened level of process," Chief Judge Chris Altenbernd, of the 2nd Court of Appeal in Florida, wrote earlier this month. </s> As expected, Florida lawmakers refused to intervene Wednesday in the case of severely brain-damaged Terri Schiavo, despite eleventh-hour lobbying by her brother and mounting pressure from Christian conservatives and anti-abortion groups.
Despite a predawn federal appeals court ruling that rejected efforts to restore nutrition to Terri Schiavo, Gov. Jeb Bush succeeded on Wednesday in getting a state court to hear new motions in her case, presenting an affidavit from a neurologist who said Schiavo's condition appeared less severe than previously thought. </s> A federal judge refused to order Terri Schiavo's feeding tube reinserted Tuesday, and as their legal options dwindled her stunned parents quickly appealed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which gave no hint when it would rule. </s> The Schindlers' lawyers also were asking a federal judge in Tampa, who had ruled against them earlier this week, to consider additional legal arguments. </s> The courts have rejected requests by the Schindlers to block Michael Schiavo from having her cremated. </s> The full US 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, Georgia, refused on Wednesday to reconsider a request to reinsert the feeding tube to a brain-damaged woman in Florida, dealing another blow to hopes of her parents to keep her alive.

Bush and others that he never engaged in an effort to disclose a CIA operative's identity to discredit her husband's criticism of the administration's Iraq policy, according to people with knowledge of Rove's account in the investigation. </s> Top White House aides Karl Rove and I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby exchanged information about their contacts with reporters regarding Valerie Plame in the days just before the CIA officer's cover was blown.
Miller, who spent 85 days in jail before acknowledging that Libby was her source, and who never wrote about the Wilsons, has said that she discussed Valerie Plame Wilson with Libby but could not say who first told her about Wilson. </s> In a disclosure that could figure in special prosecutor Patrick J. Fitzgerald's investigation, Miller said she initially refused to testify about her discussions with Libby because she believed he was signaling her that she should not cooperate in the CIA leak investigation unless her account would clear him. </s> Notes by the New York Times' Judith Miller that were turned over in a criminal investigation contain the name of a covert CIA officer, but the reporter has told prosecutors she cannot recall who disclosed the name, the newspaper reported Saturday.
The newspaper reported that Woodward told prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald, who is investigating the leak of Plame's identity, that the official talked to him about Plame in mid-June 2003. </s> Libby's attorneys discussed Cheney's authorization with federal prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald and the judge handling the case in a recent teleconference call, NBC News reported, </s> Comey gave Fitzgerald sweeping power to conduct the investigation into the leak of CIA operative Valerie Plame's identity, exempting the special counsel from following rules that apply to all U.S. attorneys throughout the nation. </s> A special prosecutor has been probing whether administration officials leaked the name of CIA agent Valerie Plame to Novak and others in an organized effort to retaliate against her husband, administration critic Joseph Wilson. </s> Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald is disputing the claim of Vice President Dick Cheney's former top aide that the prosecutor lacked the legal authority to indict him in the CIA leak investigation.
But Yonadem Kana, secretary general of the Assyrian Democratic Movement, said the general security situation of the country _ car bombings, kidnappings and murders, which affect all of Iraq's religious groups _ had chased away many Christians. </s> In an interview, Yonadem Kana, the leader of the Assyrian Democratic Movement in Iraq and a member of the Iraqi National Council, said the fighters have been deployed in Baghdida near the northern city of Mosul. </s> The few posters of Christian parties on display bear no symbols other than the map of Iraq.

When a group of Spanish astronomers reported in July that they had discovered a spectacular addition to the solar system, a bright ball of ice almost as big as Pluto sailing the depths of space out beyond Neptune, Dr. Michael Brown of Caltech chalked it up to coincidence and bad luck. </s> "It is guaranteed bigger than Pluto," said Michael E. Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at Caltech and a member of the team that made the discovery. </s> When a Caltech astronomer, Michael Brown, announced last year that his team had found a distant object three-fourths the size of Pluto orbiting the sun, he declined to call it a planet, and he even suggested that Pluto should not be considered a planet either.
Brown's claim of planethood for 2003 UB313 is certain to be controversial. </s> Astronomers at the California Institute of Technology have discovered what they believe is the tenth and most distant planet in our solar system, a ball of rock that is about twice as big as Pluto and about three times as far out.
Training Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys on Pluto on May 15 and again three days later, scientists found two very faint satellites moving in a counterclockwise orbit. </s> Pluto has three moons, not one, new images from the Hubble Space Telescope suggest. </s> A ball of ice and dust discovered last year in the outskirts of the solar system is 30 percent wider than Pluto, a team of German astronomers is reporting Thursday. </s> Scientists using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope have found that Pluto has not one, but three moons.

Under Reid's proposal, Republicans would have to withdraw the nomination of a third judge, Henry Saad, who has been stiffly opposed by Michigan's two senators, both Democrats: Sen. Debbie Stabenow and Sen. Carl Levin. </s> If Republicans leave the right to filibuster judges intact, Reid has said, his caucus will let them pick one appellate court nominee for a non-filibustered confirmation from a group the Democrats have strongly criticized: Janice Rogers Brown of California, William Myers III of Idaho, Priscilla Owen of Texas and William Pryor Jr. of Alabama. </s> Top Senate leaders declared an unsuccessful end to their compromise talks over President George W. Bush's stalled judicial nominees, despite fresh talk of a deal to clear five appeals court appointees while scuttling three others. </s> Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., offered to end three of seven Democratic filibusters of President Bush's appellate court nominees if Republicans would pledge not to change Senate rules to end the use of the parliamentary tactic to stall votes on proposed judges.
If Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee decides to exercise the "nuclear option" to end a filibuster of President Bush's judicial nominees, here is how it is likely to unfold, motion by motion: </s> Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist on Tuesday moved the chamber closer to a long-threatened showdown between Republicans and Democrats over President Bush's controversial judicial nominations.
In return, Republicans would pledge not to lend their votes to the effort to change the filibuster rules, unless at some point they think the Democrats had violated the spirit of the agreement. </s> Averting a showdown, centrists from both parties reached agreement on a compromise that clears the way for confirmation votes on many of President George W. Bush's stalled judicial nominees, leaves others in limbo and preserves Senate filibuster rules.
The Senate voted 56-43 to elevate conservative California jurist Janice Rogers Brown to the nation's most important federal appeals court Wednesday, the second of President Bush's controversial nominees to win confirmation under a special agreement between centrist Republicans and Democrats. </s> Under the deal, Democrats agreed to vote for cloture, or an end to debate, for three judicial nominees: Janice Rogers Brown, William Pryor and Owen. </s> Republican Senate leaders wanted to strip Democrats of their right to filibuster judicial nominees until a compromise in late May among centrists in both parties cleared the way for votes on some of the disputed nominees, including Brown. </s> Averting a showdown, centrists from both parties reached agreement on a compromise that clears the way for confirmation votes on many of President George W.
