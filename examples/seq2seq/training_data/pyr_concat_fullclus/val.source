By June 1, 2005 customizing A380s for 15 different client requirements, notably for different passenger entertainment systems, had delayed deliveries up to 8 months, risking millions in penalties. In 2005 the A380 was six months behind schedule and owed millions in buyer compensation. Airlines are seeking millions in damages contractually agreed upon for delays. Airbus executives say the company will have to pay millions in compensation for late deliveries of the A380.
Possible A380 air turbulence problems potentially requiring ICAO rule-making, a wing load test failure and passenger injuries during a simulated evacuation did not slow deliveries. 873 passengers and crew exited under 80 seconds and the A380 passed the test. 33 were injured in an emergency evacuation drill.
Ice continues to melt at an alarming rate in both the Arctic and Antarctic. In Antarctica and the Artic, ice melts are causing complex questions about the impact of global warming.
Global warming affects everything: oil-platforms, the society of peoples who are indiginous to the polar regions, polar animals, migratory birds, lakes (which are drying up as the permafrost melts), and even tourism. These findings are possible indications of global warming.
Arctic sea ice is melting faster. Its area is down 20% and it all could disappear this century.

A Southern Europe Gas Ring from Turkey through Greece and across the Ionian Sea to Italy is to be completed by 2006. The Southern Europe Gas Ring project is to transport natural gas from the Caspian Sea area and Central Asia through Turkey and Greece then under the Ionian Sea to Italy. An underwater pipeline from Greece to Italy is part of the plan. The southern one supplies Greece and Italy from Turkey. Construction is to begin on a Turkey-Greece pipeline to transport Caspian and Central Asian natural gas to Europe.
Gazprom, the state-controlled Russian gas group and the German company BASF plan a Baltic Sea pipeline to transport Russian gas directly to Europe. Gazprom and Germany's BASF will build it.
Faced with mounting criticism, Russia restored gas withheld from Ukraine in an alleged pricing dispute but suspected to be Moscow's meddling in Ukraine's internal politics. Russia cut the flow of natural gas through the Ukrainian pipeline in early January because of a pricing dispute.
The European Union imports some gas from Russia but parts of Europe are mainly Russia dependent. Gazprom intends to remain the leading gas supplier to Europe and to expand its markets.

Tuna's popularity in Japanese cuisine is a factor. Japan has key interest in this issue since Japan consumes approximately one fourth of the worlds tuna catch, more than any other country. Tuna is an important food source, particularly for Japan, which consumes 25% of the world's catch.
Two Tokyo-based fishing industry groups issued a statement to five international regional tuna conservation bodies calling for limits on the overfishing of tuna which is driving tuna to extinction. In October and November, commissions agreed to sharply reduce the global catch of southern bluefin and Mediterranean-caught bluefin tuna. Earlier, Mediterranean bluefin quotas were reduced and Japan halved its Pacific quota.

In a related ICCAT agreement, several countries have voluntarily slashed their tuna quotas. Also recently the European Union and Japan agreed to slash their tuna quotas by more than 20%. Recent negotiations in Tokyo resulted in the EU and Japan agreeing to slash their bluefin tuna quotas in the Mediterranean and Atlantic by over 20% by 2010 and a plan to split tuna quotas among 43 countries and regions. The EU, Japan and Morocco reduced their quotas by over 20 percent, Turkey by 13 percent.
Five international tuna conservation bodies, known as Regional Fisheries Management Organizations adopted a joint action plan, pledging to strengthen efforts to combat tuna overfishing and ensure sustainable use of tuna. Fisheries management organizations adopted a nonbinding plan to reverse tuna stock declines. Kobe summit representatives agreed in principle to an unprecedented international plan to curb tuna overfishing. For the first time, the five global bodies regulating tuna fishing approved in principle a plan to save tuna from overfishing, including measures to monitor the animals' populations across regions and ensure sustainable use of resources.
A follow-up meeting is scheduled for early 2008 in the US. A follow-up meeting was scheduled for early 2008 in the USA.

African nations need a unified plan. CITES, the UN agency regulating this trade, urged African countries to overcome their divide over the ban.
Japan and Singapore had large shipments of ivory seized. Four years ago, a ship seized in Singapore carried over 6 tons of elephant ivory, the largest shipment of the contraband material since its international trade was banned in 1989.
It was overwhelmed by an exploding demand for ivory in Japan and China and declining support for anti-poaching programs, placing the elephant at renewed risk. A study released on Tuesday, February 27, 2007, by wildlife/law enforcement officials concluded that the 1989 ban on international sales of ivory has been overwhelmed in the face of exploding demand for ivory in Japan and China.
Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa also oppose the ban because they have managed their elephant populations in a controlled manner. Kenya, Botswana and Namibia proposed commercial trade of raw ivory between themselves, South Africa and Zimbabwe, and Botswana sought a sale of 48 tons of raw ivory it possessed. On May 23rd, fourteen African countries supported a 20-year moratorium on ivory trade to allow its elephant population to recover; however, Botswana, Nambia, South Africa and Zimbabwe submitted a contrary proposal saying they worked hard to protect their elephant populations which are now ballooning.
CITES authorized sale of 60 tons of ivory to Japan. On June 2nd, the international body regulating wildlife trade authorized 60 tons of ivory to be sold to Japan by Nambia, Botswana, and South Africa.

Doctors are researching ways to determine a person's risk of developing cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. Tests and studies are being developed to aid in the fight and prevention of cardiovascular disease which affects an estimated 71 million Americans.
Certain gene variations may predispose women to heart disease. A certain gene variant predisposes women to heart disease.
A British study found that childhood trauma can lead to heart disease. Studies show that congenital heart disease (CHD) among children AND adults have become more prevalent, air pollution is dangerous for postmenopausal women, and that childhood trauma and stress can lead to increased risks. Frequent childhood abuse increases later risk of heart disease because the body's inflammation-fighting mechanism is damaged.

A Greek study showed that men who took regular 30 minute naps were significantly less likely to die from a heart attack. A 2007 Harvard School of Public Health study of Greek men concluded that napping was more effective than diet or physical activity in lowering heart attacks and other heart disease. Sleep is beneficial and regular naps decrease heart disease risk. Reduce stress through naps.

Children, especially age 2 and under, have suffered serious health problems, including death, after receiving over-the-counter cough and cold medicines,often attributed to accidental overdoses. There are over 800 over-the-counter pediatric cough and cold products. Over-the-counter cough and cold medicines are ineffective in young children and may harm them. A US Food and Drug Administration review of the safety and effectiveness of cough and cold medicines for children under two suggested that all of these ''infant'' drugs should be removed from the market, and measurement devices should be standardized to reduce risks of overdosing. The FDA is urged to ban OTC cold products for children under 6 and will consider action in October. On March 1, 2007, the Food/Drug Administration (FDA) started a broad safety review of children's cough/cold remedies.
In 2004-5, 1500 U.S. children under 2 suffered serious health problems. Over 1,500 2 yr. olds were affected in 2004-2005.
A US Food and Drug Administration review of the safety and effectiveness of cough and cold medicines for children under two suggested that all of these ''infant'' drugs should be removed from the market, and measurement devices should be standardized to reduce risks of overdosing. On March 1, 2007, the Food/Drug Administration (FDA) started a broad safety review of children's cough/cold remedies. The FDA has issued a public health advisory, banned future manufacture of  hydrocodone products for children, and launched a review of decongestant, antihistamine, cough suppressant and expectorants use for children.
The FDA is urged to ban OTC cold products for children under 6 and will consider action in October. Pediatricians and public health officials petitioned the FDA  to ban marketing cough and cold medicines for children under six.
An expert FDA panel voted to ban over-the-counter cold products for children under age 6. And while the same panel voted 21-1 to ban them for infants, the vote for 2-5 year olds was 13-9. On October 19th, an FDA panel voted to ban OTC cough/cold products for children under six, but manufacturers said they would fight these recommendations. An FDA panel voted 21-1 to ban use of OTC cough and cold medicines for children under 2.
OTC pediatric medications, of which 800 are sold, have caused convulsions, heart problems, breathing trouble, neurological complications, brain scarring, seizures, and 123 deaths. About 800 pediatric cold products sold in the US contain some 39 drugs considered unsafe for young children.
Antihistamines risk breathing stoppage. Products labeled "DM" should be avoided.
Because children and adults react differently to medicine, it called for new research to test products in children. Few clinical studies have been done on their effectiveness.
About 800 pediatric cold products sold in the US contain some 39 drugs considered unsafe for young children. An expert FDA panel voted to ban over-the-counter cold products for children under age 6. The Consumer Healthcare Products Association asserted that the drugs were both safe and effective for children under 6. An FDA panel voted 21-1 to ban use of OTC cough and cold medicines for children under 2. The American College of Chest Physicians, the Center for Disease Control and the American Academy of Pediatrics expressed concern about the use of over-the-counter cough and cold medications for children under 6. And while the same panel voted 21-1 to ban them for infants, the vote for 2-5 year olds was 13-9. An FDA expert panel urged the FDA to ban over-the-counter cough and cold medications for children under 6 as ineffective and possibly dangerous.
Lake Mead is a primary reservoir of Colorado River water which supplies millions of million people and a million acres of farmland. This river supplies water to crop/ranch lands and 25 million people. Attention has focused on the Colorado River, which supplies water to 25 million people and millions of acres of farm and ranch land in seven states.
An eight-year drought has slowed the river, leaving Mead now half-full. As a result, its two biggest reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell have become half empty, and may never completely refill. Drought, since 1999, has left the largest reservoirs on the river, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, half full.
As a result, its two biggest reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell have become half empty, and may never completely refill. Some experts say they might never refill. If current trends continue, Mead might never completely refill.
Prolonged drought, population growth, and the prospect of climate change have compelled officials in the Southwestern states to take measures to manage their water supplies. A newly-signed seven-state accord establishes specific Lake Mead water-levels as triggers for stringent water conservation measures. The states are now focusing on water conservation regulations.
Prolonged drought, population growth, and the prospect of climate change have compelled officials in the Southwestern states to take measures to manage their water supplies. The Colorado River, a key water source for seven southwestern U.S. States and Sonora, Mexico, has undergone severe droughts since 2000. Sharing of the Colorado river water is critical to keep the reservoirs of Lake Powell and Lake Meade filled. Drought, since 1999, has left the largest reservoirs on the river, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, half full. An eight-year drought has slowed the river, leaving Mead now half-full.
The study said there is a 50% chance of this happening. Lake Meade, the vast reservoir for the Colorado River water could be run near dry by 2021, according to study by scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. They now believe there is a 10% chance Lake Mead could be dry by 2014, or a 50% chance by 2021. A Scripps Institution of Oceanography study indicates that Lake Mead has a 50% chance of becoming unusable by 2021 if the current unsustainable demand for water remains unchanged and if climate change follows current forecasts. Earlier, in February, a study relying on historical records and computerized climate models was released by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, warning that Lake Mead had a 50 percent chance of being unusable by 2021.
But heavy rains from a very wet winter of 2007 and 2008 have at least temporarily raised lake levels higher than the last 10 to 12 years. Abundant snow during the winter of 2007-2008 and a cool spring combined to increase the flow of the Colorado River, thereby partially refilling Lake Powell and Lake Mead. Fortunately, above-average snowpacks created this winter and spring have increased the Colorado River's flow by 20% this summer.
They now believe there is a 10% chance Lake Mead could be dry by 2014, or a 50% chance by 2021. The study claims there to be a 10% chance Mead would be dry by 2014 and a 50% chance that levels would drop too low for hydroelectric power generation by 2017.
The NFL has told Vick to stay away from training camp. Vick was temporarily banned from the NFL and his career is in jeopardy. Vick is barred from training camp while the NFL investigates.
The indictment also stated that dogs found unfit for fighting were often killed, and that Vick was consulted in one such death. The dogs were reported killed in fighting, shot, hanged, or drowned.
Animal rights groups protested. The allegations detailed in an indictment sparked protests and awareness campaigns by animal rights groups.
He was released without bond. NFL star Michael Vick pleaded not guilty to federal dog fighting charges and was released without bond until his trial date.
The case began on April 25th, when 66 dogs (55 pitbulls) and dogfighting equipment were found on property owned by Vick in Surry County, Virginia. Investigators found dogs and Bad Newz Kennels dogfighting equipment on Vick's property in Surry County, Virginia. On April 25 investigators conducting a drug search at Vick's home found 66 dogs and dog fighting equipment.
The Southern Christian Leadership Conference has withdrawn it decision to honor Michael Vick at its annual conference. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference backed off its vow to honor Vick at its convention.
Because of the potential new charges and the news that his remaining co-defendants are scheduled to enter guilty pleas this week, Vick's attorneys are trying to negotiate a plea deal that would limit his prison time and save his NFL career. Co-defendants Purnell Peace and Quanis Phillips scheduled plea agreements before Judge Henry Hudson.
These charges fall under US racketeering law and carry a potential 20-year prison sentence. The US Attorney's office announced that it will seek a second indictment against Michael Vick for gambling on dogfights when a federal grand jury meets next week. Additionally, the prosecutor said he was seeking to bring racketeering charges against Vick, which could result in a 20-year sentence. The other pleas put pressure on Vick to plead guilty to avoid additional charges of gambling and financing the fights. Federal prosecutors will seek a superseding indictment that includes an additional charge under the RICO statute and potentially 20 years in prison.
Vick has not yet decided whether to plead guilty. Vick will likely make a plea that limits his prison time but is waiting to hear from the NFL about consequences to his career.
At least four people are dead, 79 injured and about 30 are missing. At least six people were killed and 79 injured when steel arched 8 lane bridge collapsed over the Mississippi River plunging vehicles and massive chunks of concrete into the rushing waters. A major interstate highway bridge in Minneapolis buckled and collapsed into the Mississippi during evening rush hour on 8/1/07 killing at least four people and injuring 79 others as 50 vehicles plummeted into wreckage and strong currents.
The death toll is expected to change, as divers search for bodies trapped underwater. Divers were looking for survivors and bodies.
The bridge was undergoing repairs at the time. At the time of the accident construction closed several lanes and a jackhammer was in use. The bridge, which was found to have structural deficiencies in 2005, was undergoing repairs when it collapsed.
The bridge, which was found to have structural deficiencies in 2005, was undergoing repairs when it collapsed. Inspection two years ago found structural deficiencies, but did not call for closure or immediate repair. However, a report to to the federal government designated the bridge as structurally deficient. The 40 year old bridge was recently inspected and judged to need a deck replacement in 2020 or beyond.
The governor said the bridge had been inspected and had no major problems. Inspection two years ago found structural deficiencies, but did not call for closure or immediate repair.
Divers located four submerged cars. Saturday, the Mississippi's murky, swirling waters hampered recovery efforts, forcing divers to suspend operations to recover bodies they could see trapped below in the I-35W Bridge wreckage.
30 are counted as missing. The death toll is now five, with at least eight still missing. Three days after the Minneapolis bridge collapse the death toll stood at five, with eight people missing.
President Bush visited the scene with Governor Pawlenty, promising help to fund and expedite rebuilding. President Bush toured the area Saturday and promised to expedite federal aid to rebuild the bridge.
President Bush toured the area Saturday and promised to expedite federal aid to rebuild the bridge. Stepped up inspections and federal funds have been earmarked for a replacement bridge. President Bush visited the scene with Governor Pawlenty, promising help to fund and expedite rebuilding.
Authorities don't know the cause of the collapse, but believe this may offer a clue. Only the north half of the bridge collapsed, causing most of the damage.
Reviews of earlier inspections and comments by experts identified possible causes, including metal fatigue and scouring of pier foundations by river currents, with construction activity and heavy traffic as exacerbating conditions. Minnesota officials were warned as early as 1990 that bridge was ''structurally deficient.'' Minnesota officials were warned in 1990 that the collapsed freeway bridge was structurally deficient and warned again in a 2005 federal government report. In 1990 and in 2005 the federal government gave the Minneapolis I-35W bridge that collapsed into the Mississippi river on Aug 7 a rating of ''structurally deficient'' but not in need of urgent replacement.

Thirteen died when a nearby underground pipeline ruptured. The event caused a gas pipeline to explode killing 13.
Villages and industries were submerged and thousands displaced. According to the gas company, a gas well near Surabaya, Indonesia that has spewed steaming mud since May 2006, killing 13 people, submerging villages,  fields, industries and railroad tracks, was a natural disaster. An Indonesian  volcano, known as ''Lusi,'' has spewed steaming mud since 29 May 2006, submerging four villages, factories, and fields. By February mud had submerged villages, industries and fields near Surabaya and left 15,000 people homeless.
Efforts to stem the flow have proved unsuccessful. Efforts to divert the mud flow haven been unsuccessful.
Social Minister Aburizal Bakrie, whose family owns Lapindo, blamed a distant earthquake. It erupted from a gas well near Surabaya, East Java operated by Lapindo Brantas, Inc., owned by the Bakrie Group.
It   disgorges between 7000 and 150,000 cubic meters of mud daily, forcing 13,000 people to flee their homes. An Indonesian  volcano, known as ''Lusi,'' has spewed steaming mud since 29 May 2006, submerging four villages, factories, and fields.
Poor mining techniques were to blame. Most experts believe the mud leak was caused by technical errors in the company's exploratory drilling. British experts who analyzed satellite images of the affected area concluded that the mud volcano was probably a result of drilling. In May 2008 a gas drilling site in East Java, Indonesia, began spewing steaming mud, triggered by Lapindo Brantas Inc. drilling through overpressured limestone without sufficient precautions.

Some 500 protestors demanding compensation for homes submerged by a mud volcano blocked a main road junction and railway, causing major traffic congestion.
Kempthorne added his department is not taking a position on why the ice is melting; that's beyond the scope of the Endangered Species Act. Government balked because it would mean limiting global warming, and prevented scientists from speaking freely. The administration has prohibited its scientists, when acting as government representatives, from linking human factors to polar bears and global warming.
Kempthorne added his department is not taking a position on why the ice is melting; that's beyond the scope of the Endangered Species Act. The designation prohibits federal agencies from authorizing anything, including oil drilling, that would harm the bears' habitat.
Greenland cut its polar bear hunting quota. Greenland cut its bear hunt quota.
Environmentalists cite declines in polar bear populations and forecasts of possible extinction in fifty years and argue that only action against climate change can save the bears for future generations. Beloved polar bears could disappear.
Polar bears depend on sea ice to travel, hunt, and give birth, but ice is melting due to global warming caused by industrial emissions. The polar bear has become a symbol for the dire effects of global warming as Arctic icepack, critical for its survival, has shrunk. In December 2005, three conservation groups sued the federal government blaming global warming for sea ice melting. NASA has reported the loss from global warming of 30 percent of the Arctic Ocean's sea ice.

More than 500,000 people commented. More than 500,000 people commented on a government proposal to list polar bears as ''threatened'' under the Endangered Species Act, reflecting a widespread and unprecedented sense of urgency about their fate.
Shrinkage of sea ice continues apace. A recent US Geological Survey report cited the UN's prediction that sea ice off Alaska will probably shrink to nearly half the area it covered in 1980, with profound effects on mammals dependent on sea ice. In September, the U.S. Geological Survey released a report basically stating that even with drastic worldwide reductions in greenhouse gasses, the polar ice cap will continue to shrink for the next 50 years wiping out most of the bears habitat.
Some scientists conclude that even major efforts to curb greenhouse gases would not prevent sharp declines or even extinction. In September, the U.S. Geological Survey released a report basically stating that even with drastic worldwide reductions in greenhouse gasses, the polar ice cap will continue to shrink for the next 50 years wiping out most of the bears habitat. Prospects for the bears appear quite dire. Two-thirds could disappear by 2050 and all by the end of the century. The report said polar bears would disappear from Alaska by 2050.
The Bush administration consistently suppressed science on polar bears and global warming. An Interior Department report edited out language in studies mentioning global warming as the cause of the polar bears' plight.

A British study found that sleep deprivation seems to negatively impact women's health more than men's. Women's health is at much greater risk than men's.
Taking short naps during the early afternoon does help but is mostly not accepted in U.S.A.  Adults should get between 7 to 9 hours sleep each day, more for young adults and children. For adults, napping has rejuvenating effects and boosts alertness, performance and productivity. Daytime naps allow the body to recharge.
Other treatment options include meditation, exercise or evening activity. Treatment options for sleep disorders include meditation, exercise, and bright light and evening activity.
In addition to its physiological manifestations, lack of sleep can negatively affect one's emotional state, mental abilities, performance, and productivity. Studies have found the amount of sleep a person gets affects his or her physical health, emotional well-being, mental activities, productivity and performance.
In addition to its physiological manifestations, lack of sleep can negatively affect one's emotional state, mental abilities, performance, and productivity. Studies have found the amount of sleep a person gets affects his or her physical health, emotional well-being, mental activities, productivity and performance. Lack of sleep adversely affects memory function and athletic performance. Getting enough sleep helps memory, coordination and overall better mental and physical performance.
Recent studies have linked insufficient sleep to a variety of health issues, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Lack of enough sleep can cause many health problems, including cardiovascular problems, cancer, breast cancer, increased mortality, and increase sensitivity to pain.
Lack of enough sleep can cause many health problems, including cardiovascular problems, cancer, breast cancer, increased mortality, and increase sensitivity to pain. Many studies show that getting insufficient sleep can lower your metabolic function, increase sensitivity to pain, and increase mortality.
Studies have also shown that shift workers have a higher rate of health problems because of lack of sleep and disrupted circadian rhythms. There is compelling evidence that night-shift workers face a significantly increased risk of cancer. Night-shift workers are at higher risk for developing cancer, reproductive health problems, mental illness and gastrointestinal disorders in addition to the usual array of sleep deprivation-associated problems.
Children, on average, fail to get the minimum recommended amount of sleep, leading to poorer grades and potential disciplinary problems. Sleep deprivation has been liked to poorer grades, moodiness and depression in children. A study reported that 15 million American children are affected by inadequate sleep, leading to poor grades, moodiness and depression. Sleep deprivation is especially problematic for teenagers, whose shifted body clocks and increased sleep needs conflict with early school hours and lead to increased disciplinary problems, poorer grades and traffic accidents.
Reduced sleep in of older adults is suspected to be a cause of onset of type 2 diabetes. Research continues to provide insight into the links between sleep deprivation and serious health problems such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.
Poor sleep habits have also been linked to weight gain. Research continues to provide insight into the links between sleep deprivation and serious health problems such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.
Too much sleep is also unhealthy, causing problems similar to not getting enough sleep. Studies have also determined that too much sleep can negatively affect one's health.
Sleep deprivation is especially problematic for teenagers, whose shifted body clocks and increased sleep needs conflict with early school hours and lead to increased disciplinary problems, poorer grades and traffic accidents. Sleep deprivation among teenagers creates a negative spiral of fatigue, emotional instability, poor decision-making and risky behavior.
The findings suggest that loss of sleep, even for a few hours during the night, can prompt a person's immune system to attack healthy tissue and organs, increasing the risk of autoimmune disorders. A study found lack of sleep to be associated with an increased risk of developing autoimmune disorders.
Research continues to provide insight into the links between sleep deprivation and serious health problems such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. The closer researchers examine sleep, the more they learn about the benefits of sleeping.

Taylor, the first African leader to be tried for war crimes in an international tribunal, allegedly orchestrated and funded rebels' unspeakable atrocities in Sierra Leone in exchange for ''blood diamonds'' illegally mined there. Concerning the mutilation charges, Taylor's atrocities alledgely include 7000 citizens of Sierra Leone who had arms, legs, ears and noses removed.
Most of the prosecution witnesses will testify under pseudonyms, although the defense will know their identity. Dozens of witnesses will be called, many under pseudonyms to protect their identities.
In a letter to the judge, Taylor said he would defend himself. Claiming inadequate defense and that the court is a charade, Taylor has dismissed his lawyers and told the court that he would not attend. Instead, he sent a letter in which he complained of insufficient resources to defend himself and dismissed his attorney.
The trial will probably last 18 months since the prosecution has 150 witnesses to take the stand. The trial is estimated to go on for 18 months with the prosecution taking almost a year. The trial is expected to last 18 months.
The trial will probably last 18 months since the prosecution has 150 witnesses to take the stand. The Taylor trial will begin with the prosecution's four-hour opening statement, and then will adjourn until 25 June 2007, when it will hear the first of 150 scheduled prosecution witnesses. Prosecutors plan to call 150 witnesses.
If found guilty, Britian has agreed to imprison him. If convicted, Taylor would serve his remaining years in British jail. If convicted Taylor must be imprisoned for a specific number years and will serve the time in a British jail.
Charles Taylor's war crimes trial began June 4 without him present. Surprisingly, or perhaps not, the day the trial was to begin, Taylor dismissed his defense lawyer, and refused to appear at his trial. Claiming inadequate defense and that the court is a charade, Taylor has dismissed his lawyers and told the court that he would not attend.
Studies have revealed that raising vitamin D levels may help prevent colorectal cancer by two-thirds and breast cancer by half. Both studies found that taking 2000 international units of vitamin D3 daily, and a little sunshine could cut breast cancer cases by half and colorectal by two-thirds. The studies found a possible 50% reduction in breast cancer and 66% in colon cancer in  whites.
The two major studies were conducted by a core team of cancer prevention specialists at the Moores Center at the University of California. Two new vitamin D studies, published by Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, in February 2007, revealed new prescriptions for preventing breast and colorectal cancers.
Vitamin D3 is available through diet, supplements, and exposure of the skin to sunlight. Both studies found that taking 2000 international units of vitamin D3 daily, and a little sunshine could cut breast cancer cases by half and colorectal by two-thirds. An important source of vitamin D is sunshine which may explain people in warmer climates have more of it and a lower incidence of these cancers than people in more northern areas.
Vitamin D3 is available through diet, supplements, and exposure of the skin to sunlight. Vitamin D is also available through supplements and certain foods.
Also, Dr. Michael Thun of the American Cancer Society favors keeping the dosage level at 200-600 IUs, stating 2000 units is potentially dangerous. Some doctors still recommend keeping the current levels in place for now until more studies are done. Experts differ on how much people should take in artificial substitutes. Some medical groups are urging people to increase vitamin D intake to reduce cancer risks.
Vitamin D increases did not lower the incidence of cancer a 17,000 person decade study by the National Cancer Institute concluded. It found no sign that vitamin D lowered the overall risk of dying from cancer except for significantly lowering the risk of death from colorectal cancer. An NIH study of the correlation between vitamin D and overall cancer survival found no correlation except for colorectal cancer. A U.S. National Cancer Institute study published October 30, 2007, found no sign that vitamin D lowers the overall risk of dying from cancer.
The federal government plans to update its vitamin D guidelines. Recent research indicating vitamin D may have multiple health benefits has ignited a debate over whether federal guidelines are insufficient, leaving millions vulnerable to diseases.
Dermatologists express concern about too much sun causing skin cancer. Moderate sun exposure may outweigh the associated skin cancer risks.
The study cautioned that the issue is far from settled and advised people not to assume vitamin D is a cure-all and consume large doses. Johanna Dwyer of NIH cautioned that the public should not assume that vitamin D is a magic bullet and consume high amounts.
Researchers found non-whites absorb the suns light at lower levels. A University of Toronto study found that non-white ethnic groups have insufficient levels of vitamin D, putting them at higher risk for debilitating diseases.

Survivors said the ferry took on water in the heavy seas and sank in 10 minutes. The ferry Senopati Nusantara sank off the coast of Java late Friday, 10 minutes after dropping anchor and being pounded by heavy waves for 10 hours.
Less than half of the 600 passengers and crew survived. An Indonesian ferry boat with some 600 persons on board sank on December 29, 2006 as it neared the end of a two day journey from Borneo to Java. Around 600 were on board the ferry licensed to carry 850. A ferry sank en route from Kumai on Borneo island to the Javanese port city of Semarang on Friday, December 29, 2006, carrying 542 passengers and 57 crew.
Some survivors in life rafts had been spotted by aircraft, and food and water was dropped to them, but continued bad weather was hampering rescue attempts. The bad weather has made the rescue attempts very difficult, with food and water being dropped to people in life boats. Emergency rations were dropped to those who could not be picked up in the rough seas Helicopters located 3 life rafts with 30-40 survivors but heavy weather prevented picking them up so they dropped food and drink to them
By January 3, around 200 people had been rescued from the sea by naval vessels and fishermen, and an unknown number of bodies had been recovered. Warships, fishing vessels, and helicopters have fought the bad weather and very rough seas. Warships, fishing vessels, and helicopters were involved in the search. By Monday night fishermen and navy teams found 218 survivors, in lifeboats, clinging to debris, or on beaches.

The captain of the ferry was rescued but he remains in the hospital. 245 people including the captain were rescued out of 628 on board.
Survivors thought hundreds of passengers had probably gone down with the ferry. Many passengers could not escape the sinking ship and perished immediately.
Indonesia widened the search for survivors of the December 29 disaster after 13 were rescued Wednesday clinging to an oil rig 350 kilometers away. from where the ferry was thought to have sunk, prompting officials to expand the search zone further east. Indonesia has widened the search for the hundreds missing after a car ferry sunk at the end of Dec 2006. Strong winds and the sea currents have carried the survivors for 100s of miles, therefore the search had to be widened.
Fishing trawlers endanger the spiny dogfish, which travels in schools and is slow to reproduce. Reefs are vital ecosystems which support diverse undersea populations, protect shores from storms and generate billions in trade and tourism dollars. They are threatened by pollution, overfishing; climate change, coastal development, deforestation, unrestricted tourism; destructive fishing methods, over-harvesting for commercial trade and ship groundings.
Among the reasons for corals' decline are excessive harvesting, pollution, over-fishing, diseases, and climate change.

Researchers halted two studies of an anti-AIDS vaginal gel after early results suggested it raised the risk of infection. Preventing spread of HIV has not been very successful, researchers have halted what appears to be unsuccessful test of anti-AIDS vaginal gel. Tests of one antimicrobial vaginal gel were halted in failure.
Treating genital herpes was found to help reduce levels of HIV in the blood up to 70%. Some success has been found using drugs that treat genital herpes and male circumcision test have shown to reduce spread of AIDS by 50%. One study found that a drug used to treat genital herpes reduced levels of HIV in the blood by 70 percent.
Male circumcision, a difficult measure to implement, has proved to reduce the risk of HIV infection by half. Circumcision has been found to halve the risks of men contracting HIV. Some success has been found using drugs that treat genital herpes and male circumcision test have shown to reduce spread of AIDS by 50%. Meanwhile, successful trials conducted in several countries showed that male circumcision more than halves the risk of HIV infection.

Malawi, and the world, was urged from UNAIDS and the World Health Organization to consider circumcision which could reduce the risk of HIV in half among men. Malawi is debating whether to adopt male circumcision as policy.
South Africa is implementing a new UN-approved five-year program designed to halve the incidence of HIV infection. Health ministers from the Southern African Development Community are meeting to deal with AIDS and other serious health issues. Malawi and South Africa are mapping out comprehensive plans to combat the AIDS epidemic, which has particularly devastated southern Africa.
Meanwhile, the World Health Organization and UNAIDS have endorsed male circumcision as an important intervention that offers partial protection from HIV ,but health officials emphasize that circumcision alone is not enough and should be employed along with other preventive measures such as condom usage, abstinence, better sex education, and a reduction in the number of sexual partners. Circumcision needs to be part of a mass effort that includes education and condoms to help prevent HIV.
The Securities and Exchange Commission went to court and had Madoff's assets frozen. SEC investigators and forensic auditors are investigating what Madoff did with the money and are looking at banks and money managers who steered clients to Madoff.
He was freed on $10 million bail. Madoff was freed from jail on $10 million bond. The charge is being contested and he is now on bail.

Spain's largest bank, Santander, believes it may have lost over $3 billion. Individual investors, charities, hedge funds, and various financial institutions were among the fraud victims. Among those duped were top US investors, large European banks, and a Tokyo bank.
On 12 December 2008 Bernard Madoff Investment Securities collapsed hours before Madoff's arrest for stealing some $50 billion from investors in fraudulent financial moves. Wall Street financier Bernard Madoff was arrested on December 11, 2008 and charged with securities fraud after he allegedly confessed to his sons that he had swindled investors out of $50 billion through a giant pyramid scheme.
SEC investigations of Madoff in 2005 and 2007 found no major problems and were closed. The SEC had twice conducted inquiries of Madoff but had detected no wrong doing despite the existence of certain warning signals. The SEC, who is now saddled with increased investigations, is embarrassed over missing key indicators in the Madoff firm over the years.
Madoff's arrest on charges of securities fraud raised serious questions about the U.S. financial regulatory system. The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) is liquidating the Madoff Investment firm following his arrest on a securities fraud charge.

Bernard Madoff insisted that no family member was involved in the Ponzi scheme and Federal investigators found no evidence of family member involvement. No evidence surfaced that Madoff's family helped him.
This shortage is affecting fish and migratory bird survivals, crop productions, availability of drinking water, and numerous maritime shipping problems. The Yangtze River, which provides water for navigation, factories, hydroelectric plants, agriculture, fish stocks, and humans, hit a record low. River levels dropped sharply to record lows in 2007, after bad droughts, hurting fish stocks, navigation and drinking water supply and worsening pollution.
SW China is experiencing a severe water shortage due to reduced rainfall, strains of economic and population growth, and disappearing glaciers and faster evaporation caused by global warming. The most serious of these issues is water shortages. Already a dry country, China faces severe water shortages as increased evaporation, due to higher temperatures, reduces supply even as ever more is needed for a growing population and expanding industrial and agricultural production. China faces water shortages because of rising temperatures (global warming), increased use by growing population, pollution of water from rapidly growing industry,  and need for dams for electrical power.
Building sea desalination plants, conservation, reducing green house gases, are how China is trying to combat water shortages. Countermeasures include releasing dam water; digging out sludge, exploding reefs, and banning large vessels to improve navigation in shrinking waterways; increasing sea water desalination; water wagons for humans and cattle; building weirs to preserve water and provide food for migratory birds; establishing consumption quotas; and reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The government plans quotas and other measures to cut average consumption, efforts to recycle industrial water and construction of desalination plants along the coast. China does plan to cut water consumption 20% by 2010.

Much of the trade in human organs takes place on the black market. Black market organ trafficking has occurred in Russia, China and the Philippines. Their aim is to encourage organ donations while preventing any black market trade in organs. In some countries, such as China and Russia, organ trafficking has become a problem. Governments and medical authorities around the world are undertaking to formulate regulations covering organ transplants.
China's military harvests organs from Falungong prisoners for sale to foreigners. US and Canadian officials are investigating China's practice of harvesting organs from prison inmates. China's military hospitals reportedly have turned to selling organs to make up for government funding cuts, with the organs taken from unwilling donors such as prisoners. Although the Chinese deny it, it has been alleged that organs have been harvested without permission from prison inmates.
Zimbabwe and the Philippines are writing transplant regulations. In recent years, countries around the world have been trying to find ways to make organ-transplant procedures more effective and legitimate. Organ donation and transplant laws and procedures are changing. The need for regulations has become apparent to lawmakers in China, Russia, the Philippines, and Zimbabwe. Governments and medical authorities around the world are undertaking to formulate regulations covering organ transplants.
US organ transplant guidelines are being changed to allowed heart transplants for infants with different blood types. More organs could become available through South Carolina's plan to shorten prisoners' sentences in exchange for organ donations, mismatched blood type organ transplants for infants, and promotion of brain-death idea for organ donation in China.
New federal standards for transplant programs were unveiled in March. On March 22, 2007, U.S. federal health officials unveiled new standards that hopefully will result in a decrease of patient deaths and failures of transplanted organs.
Under a South Carolina plan, prison inmates who donate organs could have their sentences reduced. Recent U.S. legislation approved North Carolina's prison sentence shortening for organ donation, eases giving live organs to non-family members (legalizing paired kidney donations), and sets new standards for transplant volume and survival rates that will cause some transplant programs to close.

US passed Organ Donor Leave act giving federal workers more time off if they donate organs. Some employees get extra leave for organ donations.
New approach to harvesting organs in the US is significantly increasing the available organs, where harvesting is done within minutes of the heart stopping, causing some concerns if the donor is really dead. Liver-splitting techniques and the ''donation after cardiac death'' approach to organ harvesting have markedly increased the number of organs available to those in need. More organs are becoming available as doctors increase harvesting after the heart stops rather than waiting for brain-death, and through liver-splitting.

Chinese lead-painted toys are responsible for major recalls by U.S. toy makers. Recently, RC2 Corp. recalled 1.5 million wooden Thomas & Friends trains and accessories, and Mattel recalled nearly 1 million of its Fisher-Price toy characters, all Chinese-manufactured toys found to contain excessive amounts of lead in their paint. In June, 2007, toy maker RC2 Corp. recalled 1.5 million Thomas & Friends toys that were decorated with lead paint, which can cause long-term neurological damage.
RC2 fired the company that made the toys. Toymakers recalled the toys and fired the Chinese subcontractors.
Each of the 24 toys recalled for safety reasons in the US so far this year were made in China. The recalled toys were made in China, as are at least 80 percent of all toys sold here.
Recalled toys include a toy found to be filled with kerosene, an infant rattle that was a choking hazard and toy drums sets and bears recalled for lead paint. The two toy recalls raised concerns about the safety of Chinese-made products in general.
Congressional bills propose strengthening the CPSC and ending manufacturers' self-monitoring. There is an increasing push for more regulation of the toy industry.
