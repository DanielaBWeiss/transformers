He was made procurement chief at GM headquarters. The issue stems from the alleged recruitment of GM's eccentric and visionary Basque-born procurement chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortura and seven of Lopez's business colleagues. On March 16, 1993, with Japanese car import quotas to Europe expiring in two years, renowned cost-cutter, Agnacio Lopes De Arriortua, left his job as head of purchasing at General Motor's Opel,Germany, to become Volkswagen's Purchasing and Production Director. A ruthless restructurer, he recruited General Motors' likeminded global head of purchasing Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. Lopez was procurement chief at Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary. Jose Lopez as head of purchasing at Adam Opel, GMs German subsidiary, led the company to become the most profitable car maker in that country.
European government and industry leaders expressed fear that defensive allegations by VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech, that the Lopez incident amounted to U.S. industrial warfare against Germany, would destabilize U.S.-European commercial and diplomatic relations. Ferdinand Piech became Volkswagen chairman in January 1993 and planned to turn the money-losing company around. He was presumably recruited by VW chairman, Ferdinand Piech, who was impressed with Lopez's leading role in helping Adam Opel recover from a major production cost disadvantage. Ferdinand Piech had just been installed as Chairman of Volkswagen when he hired Lopez. As early as December, 1992, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, of GM, was in touch with Ferdinand Piech, Chairman of Volkeswagen, about coming to work for VW. VW chairman Ferdinand Piech recruited the General Motors/Opel executive, Jose Lopez de Arriortua.
The investigation is focused mainly on evidence that Mr. Lopez and his associates took GM and Adam Opel industrial secrets with them. At GM's request, German state prosecutors and the FBI began investigations into industrial espionage, theft, perjury and wire fraud. Darmstadt, Germany investigator, Dorothea Holland, launched still unresolved investigations into charges of industrial espionage, theft, and perjury against Lopez, his 22-year old daughter, Begounia, and other GM colleagues now at VW. German officials began investigating VW for theft and industrial espionage.
So far, Lopez has agreed to pay DM75,000 to set aside the perjury case against him. Lopez agreed to pay DM75,000 instead of facing perjury charges in court. In May, 1994, Lopez agreed to pay 29,850 pounds to avoid facing perjury charges in court. Lopez paid a fine instead of facing perjury charges. Lopez was accused of perjury and in May 1994 agreed, while maintaining his innocence, to pay a DM75,000 fine to avoid facing charges in court The German prosecutor, Dorthea Holland, was searching through an estimated 2 million computer printout sheets.
Months of charges and counter-charges followed and details were aired in German newspapers. This led to investigations and counter charges on both sides of the ocean followed by civil and criminal court cases.
In July, the U.S. Justice Department announced it was investigating the Lopez case. The U.S. Justice Department's interest in industrial espionage had been piqued and the FBI began an investigation of mail and wire fraud, which was also stalled. The case reached the highest levels in both countries including the US Justice Dept. and the FBI investigating mail and wire fraud.
VW was banned from further personnel poaching but a Frankfurt court denied that poaching broke fair competition rules. A regional court in Frankfurt issued an injunction preventing VW from recruiting more GM staff. With GM urging, a temporary injunction was imposed on VW recruiting, but it was subsequently lifted and manager-poaching claims against VW were rejected.
VW was banned from further personnel poaching but a Frankfurt court denied that poaching broke fair competition rules. All charges of anti-competitive staff poaching were later dismissed. With GM urging, a temporary injunction was imposed on VW recruiting, but it was subsequently lifted and manager-poaching claims against VW were rejected.
Ferdinand Piech took over an ailing VW company that was losing money. He saw Lopez as the answer to a similar ongoing problem at VW. Ferdinand Piech became Volkswagen chairman in January 1993 and planned to turn the money-losing company around.
Lopez was disappointed by GM's decision not to build an automobile plant in his own Basque country. Coincidentally, Lopez quit after being informed that a plan to install his new car dream plant in his Basque area was cancelled. Lopez had developed a new GM plant to be built in his native Basque country, but when he learned in March 1993 that it would be built in Hungary he abruptly left GM for VW, with secret GM documents he had requested that detailed GM's new plant and car models. Lopez, disappointed that GM was not going to build a plant in his native Basque country, left GM under a cloud of confusion and allegedly took some sensitive GM documents and plans with him.
The German economics minister, Gunter Rexrodt, had tried to be a peacemaker is this controversy, but in September 1993 withdrew. German economics minister Gunter Rexrodt was concerned of damage to US-German political and business relations and for a time tried to be a peacemaker.
GM charged that during his last months at GM, Lopez stole GM plans for ultra-low cost factories; designs for advanced cars and engines; and information about Opel's suppliers and parts. At GM's request, German state prosecutors and the FBI began investigations into industrial espionage, theft, perjury and wire fraud.
The industrial espionage battle by General Motors (GM) and its German subsidiary, Adam Opel, against Volkswagen (VW) for the past 18 months has bogged down in mountains of paper and a complex transatlantic tussle involving both lawyers and politicians. The legal cases soon became bogged down in mountains of papers and transatlantic issues between the countries involving lawyers and politicians.
He is accused of luring Lopez away from GM along with several of Lopez' key associates. He also took, according to considerable evidence, many GM documents, along with seven GM executives. Lopez brought with him to VW seven former GM employees including his close friend, Jorge Manuel Gutierrez. Lopez was followed by seven top members of his team, including Jose Gutierrez, Jorge Alvarez Aguirre, and Rosario Piazza. In March 1993, Lopez and seven other GM executives moved to VW overnight. The issue stems from the alleged recruitment of GM's eccentric and visionary Basque-born procurement chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortura and seven of Lopez's business colleagues.

Lopez, disappointed that GM was not going to build a plant in his native Basque country, left GM under a cloud of confusion and allegedly took some sensitive GM documents and plans with him. However, he left GM for VW under circumstances, which along with ensuing events, were described by a German judge as "potentially the biggest-ever case of industrial espionage".
Prince Andrew visited in 1994. In 1994, the Duke of York, became the first royal visitor to Argentina since the Falklands War. In 1994 Britain's Duke of York was the first official royal visitor to Argentina. In 1994, Britian's Prince Andrew made an official royal visit and Carlos Bastos, Argentine energy minister, went to London.
Relations began to improve significantly when the newly elected president of Argentina, Carlos Menem, began to policy of rapprochement in 1989. Full diplomatic relations were re-established in 1990, after Argentine president Carlos Menem took office. President Carlos Menem of Argentina who took office in 1989 has adopted a pro-western foreign policy and free market economics. Relations between Argentina and Britain began improving after President Carlos Menem took office in 1989 and adopted pro-western foreign policies and free market economics.

Relations between Argentina and Britain began improving after President Carlos Menem took office in 1989 and adopted pro-western foreign policies and free market economics.
The return to normal relations between the United Kingdom and Argentina has been gradual since the end of the 1982 Falklands War. In 1985 Britain ended trade curbs imposed on Argentina after the 1982 Falklands conflict. Argentina was still obsessed with the Falkland Islands even in 1994, 12 years after its defeat in the 74-day war with Britain.
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and Agricultural Minister Gillian Shephard visited Argentina. Throughout 1993, a series of British high-level officials visited Argentina; notably, UK foreign secretary Douglas Hurd, the UK trade and industry secretary, and UK agriculture minister, Gillian Shephard, Argentina's economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, and its foreign minister, Guido di Tella, visited London.

Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo and Foreign Minister Guido De Tella went to the UK. Diplomatic relations have continued to improve with state visits to Argentina by foreign secretary Douglas Hurd and a year later a visit to Britain by foreign minister Guido di Tella of Argentina. These developments were followed by a visit to London by Guido di Tella, Argentine foreign minister, to hold financial and trade discussions.
Britain's arms embargo continues, except for Argentine units participating with Gulf War Coalition forces. Britain and Argentina co-operated during the 1991 Gulf War and Argentine units received UK-manufactured spare parts. Militarily, both countries joined forces to support the first Iraq war. Although the UK and Argentina cooperated militarily during the Gulf War, Britain has maintained an arm embargo preventing Argentina from replacing aircraft shot down in the Falklands War.
Argentina has sought British assistance on privatization of the oil and gas industries and the development of oil resources. The two countries planned to develop oil resources in the South Atlantic jointly. In February 1992, both countries began discussions in Buenos Aires on developing South Atlantic oil resources. Joint exploration was being discussed. British Gas and YPF, Argentina's state-owned oil company, began negotiating jointly exploring offshore gas and oilfields bordering the Falkland Islands in April, 1993.
Argentina has sought British assistance on privatization of the oil and gas industries and the development of oil resources. Argentina wants UK regulatory expertise in privatization and private sector investment in Argentina's gas and nuclear industries.
Argentina briefly banned UK cattle imports and opened investigations into allegations of Falkland War atrocities by British soldiers. The refusal of Argentina to purchase cattle products because of an outbreak in the UK of mad cow disease in the 1980s created new tensions between the two countries.
Argentina briefly banned UK cattle imports and opened investigations into allegations of Falkland War atrocities by British soldiers. Argentinians visited war cemeteries in the Falklands and Scotland Yard investigated British war crimes in Argentina. Argentina demanded an investigation of alleged war crimes during the Falklands War after reports of atrocities appeared in British media.
Britain had hoped to strike an agreement with Argentina that would protect the islands' revenues, but Argentina tied such an agreement to concessions by London over shared development of the islands' possible oil reserves and lifting of the UK's arms embargo. Argentina used fishing disputes to press for oil and military compromises.
Britain extended territorial waters into disputed areas. Some differences and even anger exist between Argentina and Britain over territorial sea claims and fishing rights in the South Atlantic.
Argentine-British relations since the Falkland Islands War in 1982 have gradually improved. Argentina was still obsessed with the Falkland Islands even in 1994, 12 years after its defeat in the 74-day war with Britain. Thirteen years after the war between Britain and Argentina over the Falkland Islands, Argentina still makes a ritual reference to Argentina's sovereignty over those islands.
Argentina's main objective remains recovering sovereignty of the Falklands, thinking economic links would reduce the Falkland's importance to Britain. In theory, stronger trade and investment links with Argentina would gradually reduce the importance of the Falklands to Britain.
Argentine military officers train in the UK. Talks over resuming training Argentine officers in UK military academies were planned The two nations agree to disagree over the sovereignty of the Falklands. Argentine officer training at British academies resumed.
But the UK foreign office insisted its policy would change only if the islands' 2,000 inhabitants agreed. British conservatives want no concessions and the policy is that the status will change only when the Falklanders, who do not trust Argentina, want a change.
Argentinians visited war cemeteries in the Falklands and Scotland Yard investigated British war crimes in Argentina. Argentines visit war cemeteries in the Falklands.
Each side gives advance notice of military exercises. Each side would announce upcoming military exercises.
Argentine-British relations since the Falkland Islands War in 1982 have gradually improved. Relations between Argentina and Britain began improving after President Carlos Menem took office in 1989 and adopted pro-western foreign policies and free market economics. Although there are still remaining issues regarding the Falkland Islands, relations between Argentina and Great Britain are growing continuously cooperative. In most other areas, relations between the two countries have steadily improved.
These exchanges resulted in greatly improved financial, oil, fisheries, and military issues but GB consistently refused to address the issue of sovereignty over the Falklands. Diplomatic relations resumed in 1990, and trade and investment between the two increased substantially. Economic relations resumed much earlier and have been stronger. After 1990, rapid UK trade growth helped Argentina's "miracle" economic recovery. Commercial relations improved steadily. Economic and commercial relations between the two countries steadily improved.
Although there are still remaining issues regarding the Falkland Islands, relations between Argentina and Great Britain are growing continuously cooperative. This remains the only issue that seriously divides the two nations.
In 1985 Britain ended trade curbs imposed on Argentina after the 1982 Falklands conflict. Britain resumed trade with Argentina in 1985. Britain ended trade curbs in 1985 and Argentina lifted restrictions in 1989.
He began in August 1989 by lifting financial and trade restrictions on imports from Britain imposed during the Falkland Islands War. Britain ended trade curbs in 1985 and Argentina lifted restrictions in 1989. In 1989 Argentina welcomed British imports. Argentina lifted restrictions on British imports in 1989.
Argentina and Brazil are also major markets. PM made market gains in Russia, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Japan, Taiwan, Argentina and Brazil.
Asian markets, especially Japan, Taiwan and China, were also pursued. However, their sales assault overseas; namely, the Far East, has provided a burgeoning increase in profits. At the same time East European and Asian markets opened up with the fall of the Soviet Union and the lifting of trade restrictions.
In the U.S. PM lowered Marlboro cigarette prices to increase U.S. market share, and bolster Marlboro's image for global marketing; and increased U.S. production by 50% for overseas sales. It cut US prices to restore Marlboro's US standing.
That factory would send cigarettes to Ukraine. In Hungary PM increased cigarette exports to Ukraine.
Philip Morris expected to start producing Marlboros in Russia in 1993. The company plans to begin producing Marlboros in Russia.
RJR plans to produce Camels and other brands in Kazakhstan. R.J. Reynolds planned to produce Camels and other brands in a joint venture in Kazakhstan by late 1992.
American cigarette manufacturing companies faced with declining sales because of health concerns regarding cigarettes and restrictions on advertising began to diversify and acquire companies that produce non-tobacco products. Although the domestic market for cigarettes in America in the l990s was greatly reduced due to bans on advertising, smoking in public places, and health warnings, American tobacco companies were showing a profit most quarters due to export sales of cigarettes and diversification of products sold including food.
Philip Morris advertised intensely and invested heavily to increase production and crops worldwide. The tobacco industry initially has responded with intense advertising, lobbying in Washington, and using cash flow from tobacco operations to finance diversification into food industries.
RJR bought factories in Turkey and acquired equity in the Ukraine and Kazakhstan. They plan to build a factory in Turkey to produce cigarettes.
After exporting cigarettes to Russia to satisfy 1990 shortages, PM acquired three Russian factories. In Russia PM undercut prices of Russian businesses, and accepted barter payment for PM's first major import of cigarettes to quell "tobacco riots". Phillip Morris (with Marlboros) wooed Russian by supplying 20billion cigarettes after the 1990 tobacco riots and began planning and building factories and entering into joint ventures as the industry was privatized.

Sales of cigarettes to Western Europe continued to do modestly well in spite of competition from European companies. Competition also was heavy in Western Europe, where anti-smoking policies and laws were just beginning.
In October 1994, Philip Morris claimed to have sold 201 billion cigarettes, an increase of 18% over previous sales. PM said it sold 201 billion cigarettes worldwide during the third quarter of 1994.
It also moved into former Soviet states, building a factory in Lithuania and acquiring controlling of a Kazakhstan factory. In Asia, Philip Morris opened a plant in Kazakhstan with an eye to opening in Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Thailand, and particularly China, the biggest world market, as trade restrictions are lifted. The company also gained control of a Kazakhstan cigarette manufacturing operation. From 1990 to 1994, Phillip Morris made successful investments into private and state-owned businesses in Switzerland, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan. It also acquired production interests in Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, and China, and expanded its NC plant.
PM often entered markets with both cigarettes and food. Although the domestic market for cigarettes in America in the l990s was greatly reduced due to bans on advertising, smoking in public places, and health warnings, American tobacco companies were showing a profit most quarters due to export sales of cigarettes and diversification of products sold including food.
Two U.S. tobacco companies, Phillip Morris and RJ Reynolds, used aggressive, long-term strategies, beyond export sales, to capture new international tobacco markets which privatization had expanded from 60% closed to 95% open. So, American tobacco companies began to increase marketing overseas and invest in foreign cigarette or initiate cigarette production in foreign countries. However, their sales assault overseas; namely, the Far East, has provided a burgeoning increase in profits. These same companies realized that a lucrative market for tobacco products existed overseas, especially in the countries of the former Soviet Union and those in the Soviet bloc. To expand markets abroad in the early 1990s, American tobacco companies took advantage of weak advertising restrictions, trade barrier removal, and state tobacco monopoly liberalization, in China, Soviet Union, Japan, Eastern Europe, South Korea, France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Thailand, Taiwan, and Portugal. American companies began looking overseas for sales in the early 90s. They formed or joined multi-national conglomerates and pursued international tobacco markets as communism fell and monopolies were relaxed. Two American companies moved quickly into these markets, RJ Reynolds and particularly, Philip Morris.

Philip Morris with its world leading Marlboro brand increased sales in France, Italy and Spain. In conjunction with the Austrian state tobacco monopoly jointly bought a company near Budapest that had been making Marlboros under license. In each case, Philip Morris negotiated to primarily manufacture it's popular Marlboro brand along wit local brands.
America's tobacco companies -- namely, Phillip Morris (PM), R. J. Reynolds (RJR), BAT Industries, and Rothman's International -- have taken a more aggressive approach to selling cigarettes. Two U.S. tobacco companies, Phillip Morris and RJ Reynolds, used aggressive, long-term strategies, beyond export sales, to capture new international tobacco markets which privatization had expanded from 60% closed to 95% open.
Cyanide is used in tryptophan production. Hydrogen cyanide has been used to produce amino acid nutritional supplements. The Japanese use hydrogen cyanide to manufacture tryptophan, an amino acid used as a nutritional supplement. Another use of cyanide is in manufacturing the nutritional supplement tryptophan.
Some garden pesticides contain cyanide. Cyanide is used in pesticides and PCP.
Philippine fishermen use cyanide to catch fish. Fisheries in parts of the Philippines have been decimated by the use of cyanide in fishing. Philippine fishermen use cyanide in fishing, needlessly destroying immature fish. Some Filipinos use cyanide in dangerous and destructive (to coral reefs) fishing operations. In the Philippines some fishermen use homemade explosives and cyanide for driving fish away from reefs and into nets.
This method decimates the fish population and is linked to the destruction of area reefs. Some Filipinos use cyanide in dangerous and destructive (to coral reefs) fishing operations.
Climbers stun the bees with smoking leaves and a cyanide compound. Cyanide-leaching recovers silver from photographic film; is used to make PCP; and in Cameroon, pygmies harvest honey stun bees with cyanide-laced smoke. In Cameroon, a pygmy tribe uses smoking leaves and a cyanide compound for stunning bees while retrieving honey. Cameroon honey gatherers use cyanide to stun bees.
An unusual use of cyanide is to assist Cameroon villagers to gather honey from hives in tall trees. In Cameroon, a pygmy tribe uses smoking leaves and a cyanide compound for stunning bees while retrieving honey.
Cyanide-leaching recovers silver from photographic film; is used to make PCP; and in Cameroon, pygmies harvest honey stun bees with cyanide-laced smoke. Cyanide is used in the metal plating industry and to recover silver from used film. Other uses for cyanide are in galvanizing and other metal plating, in recovering silver from photographs and x-rays, and in fishing.
Cyanide is used widely for many purposes but most extensively in gold, silver, and copper mining, in electroplating, x-ray film recovery, and in the production of pharmaceuticals. Other uses for cyanide are in galvanizing and other metal plating, in recovering silver from photographs and x-rays, and in fishing. Cyanide used to recover silver from X-ray film caused the death of a worker when he inhaled fumes from the process. Cyanide is used to extract silver from used x-ray films.
Cyanide in galvanizing and plating produces toxics like silica, calcium, iron and zinc. Cyanide is used widely for many purposes but most extensively in gold, silver, and copper mining, in electroplating, x-ray film recovery, and in the production of pharmaceuticals. Cyanide is used in the metal plating industry, where the storage tanks pose a risk of deadly hydrogen cyanide being accidentally released. Cyanide is used in the metal plating industry and to recover silver from used film. Another industrial use of cyanide, in the form of hydrogen cyanide gas, is in the plating industry. Plating companies electroplate metal, such as that used by military and aerospace contractors, by placing it in large cyanide and acid baths. Other uses for cyanide are in galvanizing and other metal plating, in recovering silver from photographs and x-rays, and in fishing.
Five young men working in a California plating plant died in 1989 from inhaling cyanide fumes in a confined space. Five plating company workers died when hydrogen cyanide gas was accidentally created while cleaning a holding tank. Cyanide fumes killed five workers cleaning one tank. There is a reported incident of five workers in Indiana dying of asphyxiation when working in an enclosed space in the presence of the cyanide gas.
Cyanide is used extensively in gold mining through a system called "heap leach" mining, which enables microscopic bits of gold to be economically extracted from low-grade ore. A process known as heap-leach or heap mining is used to extract gold from low-grade ore. The first use in the mining industry, known as heap leaching, is a very economical and efficient way to separate small traces of gold from rock. Cost efficient "heap-leach technology," using cyanide, revolutionized gold mining in the 1970s. The heap-leach technique uses a water-cyanide solution to dissolve gold, silver, or copper from the ore.
The heap-leach technique uses a water-cyanide solution to dissolve gold, silver, or copper from the ore. Cyanide is used widely for many purposes but most extensively in gold, silver, and copper mining, in electroplating, x-ray film recovery, and in the production of pharmaceuticals. In mining industry applications a 0.1% cyanide-water solution cheaply leaches metals, such as gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead and iron from ore heaps.
Cyanide in rodent poison absorbs topically and produces poison gas and toxic run-off in fires. Cyanide is used in rodent poison.

Environmental problems arise during times of heavy rainfall when ponds overflow and run into natural streams. Mine waste-water poses an environmental hazard. The dangers of cyanide use in gold mining are its potential for environmental contamination. In mining, open ponds of cyanide and toxic metal waste, leak or flood into the environment.
A broken dam spilled cyanide-contaminated water into a creek. A South Carolina mine's reservoir dam broke and spilled sodium cyanide into a creek.
In Colorado, in 1994, a mine leaked contaminated water into the Alamosa River. A leak into the Alamosa River poisoned fish in a downstream reservoir and corroded irrigation equipment in the valley.
The ore is spread on impermeable plastic pads then sprinkled with a weak cyanide-water mixture. Ore is placed on a plastic pad and a weak cyanide solution is poured over it to pull the gold from the rock. On huge plastic pads, heaps of pulverized ore from strip mines are saturated with a cyanide solution. Crushed ore is heaped on an impermeable pad and saturated with a cyanide solution that leaches out metal then drains into a holding pond.
The waste from this process is discharged into self-contained ponds. In this cost effective method, cyanide bonds to bits of gold and the solution is then drained into holding ponds where the gold separates out. Crushed ore is heaped on an impermeable pad and saturated with a cyanide solution that leaches out metal then drains into a holding pond. The solution-coated ore is then drained into a holding pond where the gold is separated from the solution.
Environmental damage occurred when a leaking holding tank contaminated ground water and when a plating company dumped cyanide-laced waste water into the Los Angeles sewer system. A plating company in Hollywood, California was charged with dumping cyanide into the sewer system and with reckless storage of chemicals. Cyanide-contaminated sludge has been dumped into a Brazilian river and California sewers and trash bins. In Los Angeles, dumping of thousands of gallons of cyanide solution from plating operations into sewers occurred several times in 1989 and 1990.
Flora, fauna and humans die from direct contact with concentrated waste; which then flows into tributaries, rivers, lakes and reservoirs, resulting in massive kills of fish, animals and plants, and corrosion of irrigation equipment even 17 miles or more down stream, before cyanide is diluted or deactivated by sunlight. In Summitville Colorado, pollution from a mountain mine killed fish for 17 miles and corroded irrigation equipment. Within a year it had poisoned all the fish in a reservoir 15 miles downstream and threatened irrigation in the valley below.
Water diverted for mining use can dry surrounding wells and streams, destroying wildlife habitats. Diversion of water for leaching destroys wildlife habitats.
Cyanide is used in electroplating aircraft parts. Plating companies electroplate metal, such as that used by military and aerospace contractors, by placing it in large cyanide and acid baths.
A pioneering "closed-loop" cyanide leaching system eliminates open ponds and environment leaks. Some mining companies went to a "closed loop" leaching system that does away with open ponds.
Thousands of birds and animals die drinking from poisoned waste water ponds. The death of hundreds of birds and other wild animals is alleged to have been caused by contaminated mining holding ponds. Unfortunately, in some cases runoff from this cyanide process has discharged into ponds with the result that birds and animals were killed. In addition, birds and other wildlife are endangered when they see the open blue cyanide ponds and stop to drink from them. Birds drink from ponds and die by the thousands.
Dangers include improper working conditions, storage and disposal; and lack of rescue procedures. Fires at associated stores and labs can't be fought because of dangers to firefighters from toxic fumes and pollutants in runoff from waterhoses.
While the processing systems are generally safe, a number of dangerous situations may occur. Several instances have occurred in which cyanide used by electroplating companies has been improperly stored resulting in dangerous situations and causing expensive clean-ups.
Cyanide is used in pesticides and PCP. Cyanide-leaching recovers silver from photographic film; is used to make PCP; and in Cameroon, pygmies harvest honey stun bees with cyanide-laced smoke.
The solution-coated ore is then drained into a holding pond where the gold is separated from the solution. In this cost effective method, cyanide bonds to bits of gold and the solution is then drained into holding ponds where the gold separates out.
A leak into the Alamosa River poisoned fish in a downstream reservoir and corroded irrigation equipment in the valley. Potential dangers are pollution of water supplies, fisheries and air; poisoning of wildlife; lack of mine-operator diligence; and hazardous materials left at abandoned mine sites. Waste ponds foul the air, and water leaks into streams, poisoning the fish and contaminating water. This results in the destruction of fish and wildlife or may cause death to humans from breathing poisonous air or drinking contaminated water.
Environmentalists say the runoff could pollute drinking water and endanger salmon fisheries. This results in the destruction of fish and wildlife or may cause death to humans from breathing poisonous air or drinking contaminated water. Waste ponds foul the air, and water leaks into streams, poisoning the fish and contaminating water.
The World Court hears cases about embargoes imposed by one country against another, and disagreements over territorial ocean waters. It has also ruled on disputes over borders and territorial waters, citizenship rights, the placement of embargoes, and the liability of a state using its military facilities to attack another state's commercial aircraft.
Many cases which come before the World Court involve accidents of war, such as the post-World War II Corfu Channel incident in 1948 and the 1988 Iran Air Flight 655 incident in the Strait of Hormuz. Military disputes are very common cases.
The Court may also appoint an independent tribunal such as the international war crimes tribunal in 1991, charged with attempting to prosecute perpetrators of murder, rape, and enforced expulsions in former Yugoslavia. In the early 1990's, the Court also hosted the UN sponsored international war crimes tribunal, trying those accused of murder and other atrocities in the former Yugoslavia.
In 1989 Iran asked the court to declare unlawful the 1988 U.S. shoot-down of Iran Air 655 and make the U.S. compensate Iran directly, not individual Iranians. Many cases which come before the World Court involve accidents of war, such as the post-World War II Corfu Channel incident in 1948 and the 1988 Iran Air Flight 655 incident in the Strait of Hormuz.
The World Court, also known as the International Court of Justice, is headquartered in The Hague, Netherlands. The International Court of Justice in the Hague, Netherlands, also known as "The World Court" is made up of 15 permanent judges and a further two nominated by the parties involved. It is located in the Hague, in The Netherlands and has 15 permanent judges plus a further two nominated by parties going to the court. The World Court is another term for the International Court of Justice in The Hague. The International Court of Justice at The Hague, acts as a world court. The World Court, or International Court of Justice in The Hague, is made up of 15 permanent judges, plus a further two nominated by the parties involved in a case. The International or World Court located in The Hague, Netherlands is made up of 15 permanent judges plus two others nominated by the parties involved in a dispute.
The World Court found the US guilty of violating international law by mining harbors in Nicaragua. The court ruled illegal the U.S. mining of Nicaraguan harbors. It heard Nicaragua's claim that the US illegally aided the Contras and condemned the US embargo and harbor-mining of Nicaragua, prompting the US to walk out in protest. For example, when it found the United States guilty of illegally mining the harbors of Nicaragua, the US ignored its verdict, but in another case when it sided with the United States, the US worked to enforce the Court's decision.
BP oil of Britain entered a case against Iran when Iran abruptly nationalized all foreign oil interests. The Court allowed British Petroleum to argue its case when Iran nationalized foreign oil interests and overruled a UN decision declaring Namibia under South African control. When Iran nationalized foreign oil interests in 1951, British Petroleum went to the World Court. It ordered Albania to compensate Britain for losses when British destroyers struck Albanian-laid mines in the Corfu Channel, heard Iran's suit that the US compensate Iran for an Iranian airliner mistakenly shot down by the US, and heard British Petroleum's arguments when Iran's Massadeq nationalized foreign oil interests. The court heard a case by British Petroleum against Iran's nationalization of all foreign oil interests in 1951. Other notable cases include the Iranian nationalization of foreign oil interests in 1951, the US petition for release of the embassy hostages in Iran, and Libyan efforts to circumvent prosecutions of Libyan airline bombers in the mid-1980's.
An international tribunal to judge war crimes in the former Yugoslavia has been proposed and would sit in the Hague where the World Court is located. The UN Security Council convened an International War Crimes Tribunal to be held at The Hague, where the International Court of Justice is located. An international tribunal at The Hague convened to judge war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia.
When Iran nationalized foreign oil interests in 1951, British Petroleum went to the World Court. Other notable cases include the Iranian nationalization of foreign oil interests in 1951, the US petition for release of the embassy hostages in Iran, and Libyan efforts to circumvent prosecutions of Libyan airline bombers in the mid-1980's. The court heard a case by British Petroleum against Iran's nationalization of all foreign oil interests in 1951.
The World Court overruled a UN decision that declared South African control over Namibia illegal. It overruled a UN resolution condemning South African control over Namibia but reversed itself 7 years later. The court overruled a 1960 U.N. resolution refuting South African control over Namibia, and reversed itself in 1967.
In 1989 Iran asked the court to declare unlawful the 1988 U.S. shoot-down of Iran Air 655 and make the U.S. compensate Iran directly, not individual Iranians. It ordered Albania to compensate Britain for losses when British destroyers struck Albanian-laid mines in the Corfu Channel, heard Iran's suit that the US compensate Iran for an Iranian airliner mistakenly shot down by the US, and heard British Petroleum's arguments when Iran's Massadeq nationalized foreign oil interests.
The Peace Palace is the court's seat. Sixteen permanent judges preside in the Peace Palace.

A company then decides which drug to develop, taking into consideration technological feasibility of producing it, whether it will provide significant advantages in safety or efficacy, and likelihood of commercial success. The drug must pass the hurdles of safety, quality and efficacy. "Me-too" drugs similar to what is already on the market are developed only where there is a market advantage from improved safety, effectiveness or treatment cost-benefit. Prospective drugs must have high projected market share; expected superiority in safety, effectiveness, and cost-benefit; and quick profitability or long market life after regulatory approval.
These are funding, facilities construction and staffing, basic science and technology research or acquisition, analysis of new medical therapy needs, and selection of newly found drugs for actual product development based on projected market analysis and expected regulatory approval. Drug companies must be convinced that a market exists for the new product and that the pricing of the finished product will be sufficient to recoup the developmental expenditure. Drug research and development starts with a decision on which therapeutic area to target, based on medical need, potential market size, and understanding of the disease mechanism.
The process now includes creating public pressure to support the drug, including getting good reviews in medical journals. Companies generate public pressure for licensing and try to make applications compelling reading.
This is done with pre-clinical trials, then with clinical trials on humans. After the pre-clinical phase, a potential drug goes into clinical trials.
A typical trial involves three phases, with an average of 200 patients per trial. These typically involve three phases, an average of 200 patients per trial, and are the longest, most costly stages in new drug development.
These typically involve three phases, an average of 200 patients per trial, and are the longest, most costly stages in new drug development. Clinical studies are the most expensive and longest part of R&D, averaging 4-6 years, and are sometimes contracted out.
This process must be conducted internationally, because US, Japanese and European authorities often require different clinical trials. Drugs must then be licensed for sale, sometimes requiring separate clinical trials in Japan, Europe and the US. Profitable drugs are sold worldwide so trials must be conducted in the US, Europe, and Japan.
Patient data is computerized, evaluated statistically, and interpreted medically. Considerable data assembled from trials is subjected to detailed statistical evaluation and medical interpretation.
Patient data is computerized, evaluated statistically, and interpreted medically. Computers are used to keep track of the immense volumes of patient data amassed, to obviate mountains of paperwork, and to cut approval times.
The final phase, the regulatory and licensing process, has become increasingly complex and demanding. Drugs must then be licensed for sale, sometimes requiring separate clinical trials in Japan, Europe and the US.
Pen computers, electronic tablets used for writing on the screen, offer hope for obviating the mountains of paperwork associated with drug trials, especially in Phase II trials, where drugs are tested for efficacy for the first time Finally, drugs must go through expensive licensing procedures in individual countries. Drugs must go through these processes in individual countries at the same time. Volunteers to take the drug must be recruited and detailed records kept and processed to create mountains of supporting documents to submit for licensing approval in a number of countries.
Here, also, computer technology is used more and more to speed up the process. In some cases, new timesaving computer processing equipment is being installed which quickly transfers information from paper to computer. Computers are used to keep track of the immense volumes of patient data amassed, to obviate mountains of paperwork, and to cut approval times.

If the compound is not dropped at this point, it is tested for efficacy for the first time.
The pathology of the disease or condition for which the development of a new drug is contemplated must be understood. Drug research and development starts with a decision on which therapeutic area to target, based on medical need, potential market size, and understanding of the disease mechanism.
They also work closely with biotechnical engineering specialists, universities, and government research organizations. Other changes involve joint R&D programs with other companies, with universities, and with bio-technical laboratories around the world. Cooperation with government and universities can sometimes yield added funds as well as aiding in the laboratory.
Some pharmaceutical companies have cut back on the number of their R&D facilities and, in some cases, have consolidated them all into one location. Some drug companies have consolidated previous decentralized research and development facilities to make the process more efficient and less costly.
The research and development phase for creating new drugs is costly and complicated. Research and development of drugs is a complex, drawn-out, and expensive process.
Profits are reinvested for R&D, but other sources include license sales, private investors, government subsidies, divestitures, lay-offs and overhead cuts. Some pharmaceutical companies have cut back on the number of their R&D facilities and, in some cases, have consolidated them all into one location.
There are companies that have split the management of their R&D processes. Some companies have separated research from development in order to expedite development.
Scientists are using computerized chemical databases, molecular modeling graphics, and automatic gene sequencing machines to rapidly select and adapt compounds for development. Using computerized databases, molecular modeling graphics, automatic gene sequencing machines, and x-ray crystallography, they design drugs to react with target molecules. Now scientists must also have leading-edge computers and are doing molecular modeling and automatic gene sequencing.
Cases include bomb victim David Heffer; abused children Shantana Speake and Thomas Griffin; gunshot victims Gema Marie Hubler and Tanya Marie Rivera (only after giving birth); injury victims Tony Bland, Karen Eickholdt, Joel Christopher Banks, and Mark Weaver; stroke victim Estelle Browning; and cocaine-imbibing Maximo Rene Mendez. Turning off a respirator ended the lives of brain dead including Shantana Speake, beaten; Thomas Griffin, alcohol poisoning; Maximo Mendez, cocaine poisoning; Gema Hubler, shot; Joel Banks, skate board accident; Karen Eickholdt, car accident; and two pregnant women, Tanya Rivera and Marie Henderson, after their babies were delivered.
Estelle Browning (stroke victim), Mark Weaver (stab wounds), and Tony Bland (crushed at a game), all in persistent vegetative states, died after feeding tubes were removed. Cases include bomb victim David Heffer; abused children Shantana Speake and Thomas Griffin; gunshot victims Gema Marie Hubler and Tanya Marie Rivera (only after giving birth); injury victims Tony Bland, Karen Eickholdt, Joel Christopher Banks, and Mark Weaver; stroke victim Estelle Browning; and cocaine-imbibing Maximo Rene Mendez.
Routinely, doctors, patients or relatives decide whether potentially life-prolonging treatments should be started, stopped, or continued. In almost 80% of deaths in the US, a doctor, relative or patient makes a medical decision whether to prolong a life either by beginning, continuing, or ending a procedure.
Active mercy killings include Philip Lee Saylor who shot his AIDS-suffering friend Steven Charles Jenkins; Roswell Gilbert who shot his Alzheimer-suffering wife Emily; a man who shot his fatally lion-mauled friend; British doctor Alan Cox who gave an elderly patient a heart-stopping injection; Delbert Ward who suffocated his ill brother William in his sleep; and three Austrian nurses and West German nurse Michaela Roeder who gave patients lethal injections. A terminal AIDS victim and a man mangled by a lion were shot by friends.
Paralyzed patients Nancy Gamble and Kenneth A. Bergstedt requested that their life support be removed. Some people request that their respirator be stopped including Nancy Gamble, a Lou Gehries disease victim, and quadriplegic Kenneth Bergstedt. Doctors did not need court permission to remove Nancy Gamble's life support when the paralyzed Lou Gehrig's patient requested it herself.
Dr. Alan Cox was tried and convicted in Winchester, England, for the attempted murder of a patient in 1992. In 1993 British doctor Alan Cox gave a lethal, heart-stopping drug injection to end an elderly patient with chronic pain. Active mercy killings include Philip Lee Saylor who shot his AIDS-suffering friend Steven Charles Jenkins; Roswell Gilbert who shot his Alzheimer-suffering wife Emily; a man who shot his fatally lion-mauled friend; British doctor Alan Cox who gave an elderly patient a heart-stopping injection; Delbert Ward who suffocated his ill brother William in his sleep; and three Austrian nurses and West German nurse Michaela Roeder who gave patients lethal injections.

In 1990, she took sleeping pills; her husband waited until she was asleep and then slipped a plastic bag over her head. While Virginia Harper slept, her husband put a plastic bag over her head and secured it with rubber bands, after the advanced cancer sufferer failed in her suicide attempt.
Husbands kill wives, e.g. cancer victim Virginia Harper was suffocated and Emily Gilbert, Alzheimer's sufferer, was shot. While Virginia Harper slept, her husband put a plastic bag over her head and secured it with rubber bands, after the advanced cancer sufferer failed in her suicide attempt. Virginia Harper, suffering from cancer, wanted to end her life. She was in excruciating pain from advanced terminal cancer and had asked her family to help her end her life.
Mercy-driven assisted suicides include Dr. Jack Kevorkian who started an IV saline solution for Alzheimer patient Janet Elaine Adkins, who then added coma-inducing thiopental and heart-stopping potassium chloride; and Bertram Harper who placed a plastic bag over his ill wife Virginia's head when sleeping pills and alcohol put her to sleep before she could do it herself.

Often, court orders are required to have this done. In most cases, the patient is comatose or mentally unable to communicate his/her feelings and the decision to remove the life-support system is made by relatives in agreement with hospital administrators or upon authority of a local judge.
An Alzheimer's patient traveled 2,000 miles to Michigan, in1990, to commit suicide with the help of Dr. Jack Kevorkian. An Alzheimer patient traveled from California to Michigan for an assisted suicide. In Michigan, without authority, Dr. Jack Kevorkian gave a woman with Alzheimer's disease access to a device that allowed her, at her own request, to inject lethal chemicals into her body.
In 1990 in New York, small farmer Delbert Ward, 59, told authorities that he smothered his brother, Bill, 64, in his sleep, as a "mercy killing". In 1990, William Ward, 64-years-old and ill with tumors, died of suffocation, and Delbert Ward was charged with second-degree murder.
Passive mercy killings occur when people who are brain-dead or permanently comatose or vegetative after injury, accident or illness are removed from life-support equipment (feeding tubes or respirators). Frequently, patients are victims of accidents or crime, such as David Heffer, Tony Bland, Mark Weaver, and Karen Eickholdt.
Mercy-driven assisted suicides include Dr. Jack Kevorkian who started an IV saline solution for Alzheimer patient Janet Elaine Adkins, who then added coma-inducing thiopental and heart-stopping potassium chloride; and Bertram Harper who placed a plastic bag over his ill wife Virginia's head when sleeping pills and alcohol put her to sleep before she could do it herself.

Dr. Jack Kevorkian provided directions and implements for Janet Adkins to kill herself.
In 1990 in Detroit, Bertram Harper, according to an agreement with his wife, secured a plastic bag over her head, allowing her to suffocate, after the dose of sleeping pills she took while holding hands with her husband and daughter didn't kill her. In 1990, she took sleeping pills; her husband waited until she was asleep and then slipped a plastic bag over her head.
Sustainable development was promoted to exploit the environment without destroying it and create jobs for locals. Brazilian programs to reduce deforestation and CO2 emission, and promote sustainable development include "extractive reserves" which globally market renewable "rain-forest chic" products (replenishable trees, produce, nuts, latex, pharmaceutical plants); discontinuing subsidies to clear-cutting for unsustainable ranches which dislocated forest people; tree improvement; pesticide controls; minimizing roads and mineral mining impacts; increasing fish pond farming; and improving law enforcement. Extractive reserves have been formed for managed harvesting of timber, rubber, Brazil nuts, and medicinal plants without deforestation.
These include sustainable forestry (using reforestation and leaving surrounding areas intact), the creation of environmental zones to protect species, eco-businesses finding markets for the renewable resources, less intrusive mining methods, and improved government enforcement of laws and patrols of park.

Illegal coca fields and cocaine processing in the cleared land also pollutes rivers with illegal chemicals. Water, soil and air were polluted by toxic waste from oil operations, logging, goldmining, and cocaine processing. Coca growers' herbicides and refining chemicals wash into rivers. The mountains of Columbia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia face erosion and silting; a crush of oil-rush settlers; illegal cocoa fields with their herbicide and chemical run-offs; the threatened spread of cocoa plantations throughout the entire Amazon basin; and deforestation from out-dated settlement incentives in a hodgepodge of policies and contradictory laws.
Sustainable forestry and development techniques, such as reforestation, are being employed, and environmental and economic zones have been established to protect threatened species. Examples of good planning are two companies that have planted tree farms in the Amazon, reforesting while creating a profitable harvest.
New programs promote tourism, and sustainable extraction of fibers, fruits and medicinal plants. These include sustainable forestry (using reforestation and leaving surrounding areas intact), the creation of environmental zones to protect species, eco-businesses finding markets for the renewable resources, less intrusive mining methods, and improved government enforcement of laws and patrols of park.

A major problem resulting from slash and burn agriculture was the reduction of the planet?s oxygen which contributes to global warming. Namely, the slash and burn cycles by ranchers, farmers, loggers, and miners depletes the soil making it impossible to replenish the forest, causes erosion leading to floods or clogging of streams and rivers, or pollutes the water and the air which endangers humans, animals and plant life. Many of the environmental problems of the Amazon rainforest result from the slash and burn cycle of clearing used by ranchers and farmers.
Animal and plant habitats and potentially valuable species were destroyed. This development is reducing the world oxygen, creating carbon, contributing to global warming, threatening indigenous cultures, and wiping out species. Many species of plant and animal life were being destroyed, some before they had even been studied. Namely, the slash and burn cycles by ranchers, farmers, loggers, and miners depletes the soil making it impossible to replenish the forest, causes erosion leading to floods or clogging of streams and rivers, or pollutes the water and the air which endangers humans, animals and plant life.
In the early 1990s Brazil, which contains the largest area of Amazon forest, the international community, and some businesses began to take action to save the rainforest. The Amazon rain forest is a vast area in South America that includes parts of nine nations, but the greatest part of it is in Brazil. This area includes not only the Amazon itself in Brazil, but the headwaters rising in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia.
Brazil has also contracted for SIVAM, an elaborate surveillance and communications system to monitor environmental research, for border control and to combat drug trafficking. A forest monitoring system, SIVAM, now provides accurate, widespread information on the Amazon environment and its changes.
The rainforest suffers great losses from wide scale logging, illegal logging, illegal mining, chaotic development, roadway construction, and hydroelectric projects. The Amazon rain forest was heavily damaged by deforestation from increasing logging, cattle ranching, farming, mining, roadways, and hydroelectric projects. Tens of thousands of square miles of virgin forest were being destroyed by ranchers and the timber industry. Deforestation is the greatest problem for the rainforest environment and is brought about by logging for valuable hardwood timber, by land stripping for farming and cattle raising, and by road building for access to mining and oil exploration areas. Namely, the slash and burn cycles by ranchers, farmers, loggers, and miners depletes the soil making it impossible to replenish the forest, causes erosion leading to floods or clogging of streams and rivers, or pollutes the water and the air which endangers humans, animals and plant life.

Extractive reserves have been formed for managed harvesting of timber, rubber, Brazil nuts, and medicinal plants without deforestation. "Extractable reserves" such as rubber-tapping, fruit and nut gathering have been cited as forms of sustainable development; however, these are of marginal economic return. Environmental zoning created Indian reservations and "extractive reserves" to exploit forest resources (latex, Brazil nuts, valuable woods, oils, resins, fruits, medicinal plants).
The 1992 Earth Summit in Brazil fostered still under-funded first-world commitments to all nine Amazon countries for ecological data banks, forest protection and education programs to reduce global warming and preserve biodiversity, including "debt-for-nature" swaps pending debt relief. The Amazon rain forest is a vast area in South America that includes parts of nine nations, but the greatest part of it is in Brazil.
Cultural Survival, a US foundation, tries to find buyers for these products. Additionally, "extractive reserves" are being developed wherein traditional populations can carry out harvesting of traditional products with the aid of processing facilities and the creation of overseas marketing.

UNESCO has declared the Yasuni national park to be an international bioshpere reserve. Ecuador imposed protective requirements on oil exploitation in 200,000 hectares of rainforest, partially in Yasuni national park, a UNESCO biosphere reserve, in close collaboration with local Indians.
Poachers have endangered wildlife in many parts of the world, most notably in Africa but also in Asia, North America and Europe. Poachers have endangered wildlife mostly in Africa.
In Murchison Falls National Park, there were only 2,300 survivors from 14,000 elephants in the 1960s. In the 1970s and 1980s, Kenya's elephant herd was cut from 65,000 to 17,000. Over 700,000 elephants were lost to poachers collecting tusks for the valuable ivory. In Tanzania, Zambia, Zaire and Sudan over 50% of their elephant population was killed in the 1980s.
Poachers have endangered wildlife in many parts of the world, most notably in Africa but also in Asia, North America and Europe. Poachers seriously endanger wildlife around the world. Poaching endangers wildlife in many areas of the world.
In Rwanda, mountain gorillas are poached to steal infants for zoos, and for natives who collect the skulls. Rwanda was losing its gorilla population to poachers who seized infants to send to zoos while slaughtering the adults.
In Rwanda, mountain gorillas are poached to steal infants for zoos, and for natives who collect the skulls. Gorilla skulls were sold to native collectors.
In Africa, species endangered by poaching include elephants, rhinoceroses, buffalo, baboons, chimpanzees, mountain gorillas and rare birds. Uganda suffered a growing trade in chimpanzees and rare birds. In sub-Saharan Africa, elephants and rhinos are the primary victims but gorillas, hippos, chimpanzees and rare birds are also prey.
China's giant pandas and eastern Poland's bison are endangered. Poland faces some poaching of its rare bison population. Other animals which are poached include bison in Poland, giant pandas in China, and whales in the ocean. Poaching is a concern in Poland regarding bison, but efforts are made to protect yet limit numbers of Europe's largest beast. In Poland, the bison are threatened and, in the United States, black bears and birds of prey (hawks, eagles and owls) are killed.
In Northeastern US, more than 400 black bears were killed for their gall bladders which are prized as aphrodisiacs in the Far East. In the US, poachers endanger black bears for their gall bladders and birds of prey for their body parts (hawk talons, golden eagle feathers, great horned owl heads). In Poland, the bison are threatened and, in the United States, black bears and birds of prey (hawks, eagles and owls) are killed. In New England, authorities have broken-up a syndicate which poached black bears for their gallbladders which have medicinal value in the Far East. In the US, Massachusetts' wildlife authorities have recently broken a poachers' ring that slaughtered some 400 black bears.
In the western United States poachers have sought body parts of various raptors, including hawks and eagles. Even in the US poaching is a problem, particularly of birds of prey whose talons and feathers are considered collectors items. In the US, poachers endanger black bears for their gall bladders and birds of prey for their body parts (hawk talons, golden eagle feathers, great horned owl heads).
Countries where rhinos are poached for their horns include Somalia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Kenya, and Swaziland. In sub-Saharan Africa, elephants and rhinos are the primary victims but gorillas, hippos, chimpanzees and rare birds are also prey. In Africa, species endangered by poaching include elephants, rhinoceroses, buffalo, baboons, chimpanzees, mountain gorillas and rare birds. Poaching of elephants and black rhinos in central and southern Africa has been a serious problem. Swaziland lost 60 percent of its white rhino population. In Africa where extensive anti-poaching programs are constantly applied, most of the poaching focuses on elephants and rhinos whose ivory tusks are smuggled out through various African countries. Zimbabwe lost 75% of its black rhino population to poachers.
Over 700,000 elephants were lost to poachers collecting tusks for the valuable ivory. Countries where elephants are poached for their ivory tusks include Zambia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Elephants are valued for their ivory tusks and rhinos for their horns which China values for medicinal use. In Africa where extensive anti-poaching programs are constantly applied, most of the poaching focuses on elephants and rhinos whose ivory tusks are smuggled out through various African countries.
Zimbabwe legally dehorns rhinos and sells low-priced horn to remove poaching's profit. Zimbabwe and Namibia have rhino dehorning programs to remove the incentive to poach. Measurers taken to protect these species have included making safe havens for the animals, making ivory trade illegal, dehorning rhinos to decrease their value to poachers, jailing and even shooting poachers, providing economic incentives and promoting conservation. In Africa, unique tactics to reduce poaching include dehorning wild rhinos and having controlled culling and state run hunting safaris.
Kenya has been trying to protect its wildlife by offering financial incentives to local people through tourism, allowing limited hunting for food and protection of farmland, and support of small eco-culture businesses. Kenya is also considering the "privatization" of wildlife preserves by allowing quasi-private companies to run them with local farmers and hunters.
In New England, authorities have broken-up a syndicate which poached black bears for their gallbladders which have medicinal value in the Far East. In Northeastern US, more than 400 black bears were killed for their gall bladders which are prized as aphrodisiacs in the Far East.
India instituted "Project Tiger" as a national campaign to save their cats in 1973. India has launched a national campaign called "Project Tiger" to protect these animals whose skins, along with leopards and other cats, are sought for fur. A national campaign, Project Tiger, has succeeded in protecting the tiger population, now on the increase. India instituted Project Tiger.
In both India and Africa, efforts have been made to make protection of wildlife an economic advantage to their human neighbors by hiring locals (even former poachers) as game wardens and guards. Arrested poachers are reformed in the Conservation Corps and turned into honorary gamekeepers.
Namibian police smashed a major international syndicate smuggling tusks. Poaching rings were broken in India, the US and Namibia.
Countries where rhinos are poached for their horns include Somalia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Kenya, and Swaziland. Elephants are valued for their ivory tusks and rhinos for their horns which China values for medicinal use.

In New England, authorities have broken-up a syndicate which poached black bears for their gallbladders which have medicinal value in the Far East. In the US, Massachusetts' wildlife authorities have recently broken a poachers' ring that slaughtered some 400 black bears.
In Africa, improved enforcement has included more wildlife agents and game wardens, using reconnaissance vehicles and airplanes, going after bandits, high fines, and a shoot-to-kill policy. It has responded with a shoot-to-kill policy against poachers and the creation of an elaborate security network, including aerial surveillance of its parks.
Measurers taken to protect these species have included making safe havens for the animals, making ivory trade illegal, dehorning rhinos to decrease their value to poachers, jailing and even shooting poachers, providing economic incentives and promoting conservation. To prevent poaching, wildlife is guarded in parks. After establishing wildlife reserves and tough protective laws, there are four general steps to reducing poaching.
Trade in internationally banned items, especially by smuggling rings, must be stopped and stiff jail sentences imposed. Measurers taken to protect these species have included making safe havens for the animals, making ivory trade illegal, dehorning rhinos to decrease their value to poachers, jailing and even shooting poachers, providing economic incentives and promoting conservation.
The big steel companies employ manufacturing methods that require immense capital investment and many labor-intensive steps in production. They save time, energy, and money, undercutting integrated producers who transform iron ore into finished steel in many stages.
Japan was researching direct iron ore smelting, which would eliminate expensive separate coking ovens and sinterers. The Japanese are researching a method to replace the coking ovens and sinterers using one large blast furnace with two smaller furnaces attached.
They believe this method will cut costs by 10% and expected it to be operational by 2004. Commercial viability wasn't expected for ten years.
The resulting thin slab is passed on rollers through a furnace and then goes through rolling mills, emerging as coils of hot-rolled sheet steel. The thin slab is then passed on rollers through a furnace to make the temperature across its width consistent.
The new technology, called thin-slab casting, sharply cuts the time and capital costs required for steel sheet production, namely by melting scrap iron rather then pig iron, then casting the steel into two-inch slabs, and rolling them into coils, all in a single production run. Mini-mills make steel by melting scrap metal in small electric arc furnaces, avoiding the expensive process of making pig iron and reducing the number of manufacturing steps.
This process is called thin slab casting and is quicker and less capital intensive than the traditional ore to smelter process, and reduces the cost of producing a ton of steel. They start with scrap metal instead of ore, melt it in an electric arc furnace rather than coal-fired blast furnaces, and use a funnel mold to form steel into thin slabs which are immediately compressed, emerging as finished coils.
Mini-mills' non-union labor, minimum management, and lack of high benefit packages result in lower labor costs. Done in mini-mills the method takes less time, uses non-union labor and a lean organizational structure, and is less capital intensive.
This process is called thin slab casting and is quicker and less capital intensive than the traditional ore to smelter process, and reduces the cost of producing a ton of steel. The new technology, called thin-slab casting, sharply cuts the time and capital costs required for steel sheet production, namely by melting scrap iron rather then pig iron, then casting the steel into two-inch slabs, and rolling them into coils, all in a single production run. Mini-mills have lower capital demands and operating costs than traditional steel manufacturers. Done in mini-mills the method takes less time, uses non-union labor and a lean organizational structure, and is less capital intensive.
Nucor, the leading US mini-mill group, has its main plant in Crawfordsville, Indiana and is developing another in Hickman, Arkansas. Nucor Company in Crawfordville, Indiana was the first to pioneer the new technology and became the only major steel company to show a profit in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Others who built mini-mills include Chapparal, Birmingham, Co-Steel, Trico Steel (LTV, British Steel, Sumitomo Metal Industries), a Broken Hill Proprietary/Cargill partnership, an Italian group, and Spain's Integrated Steel Corporation. U.S. mini-mills, Chapparal and Birmingham, also made profits through the recession of the early 1990s. Other companies using or planning to use this technology are ARMCO (from the US steel group), Chapparal, Birmingham, Altos Hornos de Vizcaya in Spain, ISCOR in South Africa, EKO-Stahl in Germany, a joint Broken Hill Proprietary and North Star Steel venture, and a joint LTV, British Steel and Sumitomo Metal Industries venture. Other mini-mill steel producers are Chapparal, Birmingham, an Italian mini-mill group, and Co-Steel, with mini-mills in Canada, the US and the UK.

Nucor was able to open another plant in Hickman, Arkansas and has been looking at cooperative ventures in Great Britain and Europe. It also has a joint venture in Hunterston, Scotland.
Nucor is a non-unionized plant, using fewer people in production, supervisory and administrative positions than traditional plants. It achieves this with the new technology, the cheap electricity costs of its rural location, and the use of non-union labor.
Nucor had steel quality problems at start up which were easily solved. Problems of cracking and bubbling of the steel have mainly been solved.
However, steel from mini-mills is of a grade more suitable for construction than for more demanding applications, such as car-body panels. Mini-mills produce lower-grade steel for niche markets like construction.
However, steel from mini-mills is of a grade more suitable for construction than for more demanding applications, such as car-body panels. In the early stages of manufacturing, there were several quality flaws in the steel limiting the uses of the product.
However, steel from mini-mills is of a grade more suitable for construction than for more demanding applications, such as car-body panels. For instance, the steel was not suitable for automobile exteriors.
Still another new technology is strip casting which US Steel may invest in and is expected to produce a superior quality of steel. Thin-strip casting was expected to produce higher quality than thin-slab. Some other new technologies for steel production include using a hot rolling mill to produce thin strip casting, which US Steel believes produces a higher quality product, and using electric arc furnaces to replace the old coal-fired equipment.
Product doesn't suffer traditional steel's cracks but had initial quality problems and still experiences some gummy scale. Technical problems that have arisen in the new technology include the need for a tighter process control parameters and the larger issue of a thin gummy scale that forms on some of the production process.

Two robbers dressed as police officers steal 11 paintings and an ancient Chinese beaker from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. A dozen masterpieces were taken from Boston's Gardner Museum, the biggest art theft in US history.
Two portraits from London were recovered using the Loss Register when the paintings were brought to Southby's Auction House. Two portraits, brought to Sotheby's for evaluation by a man who bought them at a market, were recovered using the Art Loss Register database.
When photographs and documentation are available, identification of stolen artwork can be confirmed. Good photographic and other documentation uniquely describing the item and circumstances of its theft, are essential for the success of such registries in identifying possible stolen items.
The International Art Loss Register is a computerized database of thefts, where police can search to identify seized items. In Great Britain, the International Art Loss Registry founded by the leading auction houses (Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips) has a computerized data bases easily accessed by law enforcement authorities and insurance companies.
Stealing art works has become the second biggest international criminal activity after narcotics. Theft of precious artwork by global criminals has become common, second only to narcotics theft. Stealing art works is the second biggest international criminal activity after narcotics.
A Rubens painting stolen from a Spanish Museum was recovered in Florida and four Miami residents were arrested in connection with the theft. Suspects were arrested in both cases.
In the strange category, 20 Van Gogh's were found in an abandoned getaway car, eight Matisse's were recovered in a traffic stop, and a tiny Renoir was found in a museum washroom ventilation duct. Stolen artwork has been found in a museum washroom's ventilation duct and abandoned near a railway station.
In the strange category, 20 Van Gogh's were found in an abandoned getaway car, eight Matisse's were recovered in a traffic stop, and a tiny Renoir was found in a museum washroom ventilation duct. Two armed thieves stole 20 Van Gogh paintings in Amsterdam, but abandoned their haul in a railway station.
The publicity generated by the foundations makes it harder to dispose of stolen art. In addition to data bases and publicity, stolen art is recovered when someone seeks a appraisal or offers it for sale to dealers or auction houses, responds to a reward offer, attempts to move it through customs, or requests a ransom for the art. Recovery has come after a tip from a witness, accomplice or a citizen just reporting, anonymously or not, something suspicious, or in response to publicity by authorities, the owners or other interested parties, with or without a reward.
Stolen art has been recovered when offered to police sting operations or to legitimate buyers or dealers, who detect that the offered art is stolen through catalogs of stolen items circulated among dealers, auction houses, museums and police or by their consulting the International Art Loss Register, to which any one, not just major art holders, can report thefts. In addition to data bases and publicity, stolen art is recovered when someone seeks a appraisal or offers it for sale to dealers or auction houses, responds to a reward offer, attempts to move it through customs, or requests a ransom for the art. Auction houses often recognize artworks brought to them as stolen. It has been recognized and recovered when brought to auction houses or dealers for sale or evaluation.
The art is frequently recovered but the thieves not found. The arrest and prosecution of the culprits is even more rare than the recovery. Suspects are not always arrested.
Documentation is essential to recovering a stolen work of art. Good photographic and other documentation uniquely describing the item and circumstances of its theft, are essential for the success of such registries in identifying possible stolen items. Documentation and photographs of artwork are essential for recovery.
Three Swedes were arrested in a Belgian police sting operation. A Belgian policeman posing as an art dealer arrested three Swedes trying to sell a stolen Picasso painting.
Customs has seized stolen artwork being taken abroad. In addition to data bases and publicity, stolen art is recovered when someone seeks a appraisal or offers it for sale to dealers or auction houses, responds to a reward offer, attempts to move it through customs, or requests a ransom for the art.
Ransoms asked by thieves have led to recovery. In addition to data bases and publicity, stolen art is recovered when someone seeks a appraisal or offers it for sale to dealers or auction houses, responds to a reward offer, attempts to move it through customs, or requests a ransom for the art. Ransom attempts expose thieves to capture.
Since then, hundreds of dogs have been trained and deployed throughout the U.S. and increasing numbers of other countries, including Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Mexico. City and county police agencies, customs departments, fire departments, the Secret Service, highway patrol, border patrol, military bases and some prisons in the US and many other countries use dogs to help in law enforcement work.
Other breeds which assist law enforcement include Airedale-Belgian malinois mixes, Rottweilers, beagles, English cocker spaniels, beagle-spaniel mixes, and mongrels. The breeds of dogs most commonly used in law enforcement are German Shepherds brought to the US from Germany, Belgian malinois, and Labrador retrievers. Others include Belgian Malinoise, Labradors, Alsatians, Rottweillers, beagles, and airdailes. Several dog breeds are used in law enforcement world-wide. Other dogs used in police work are: Alsatians, Rottweilers, English Cocker Spaniels, and various mixes of pit bulls and beagles.

City and county police agencies, customs departments, fire departments, the Secret Service, highway patrol, border patrol, military bases and some prisons in the US and many other countries use dogs to help in law enforcement work. Dogs perform many different law-enforcement tasks around the world. Law enforcement agencies use dogs worldwide.
They are used by border patrol officers and customs officials to sniff out evidence of drugs aboard ships, airplanes, trains, trucks, and automobiles. A dog's keen sense of smell enables it to be trained to identify many types of narcotics, explosives, and flammable material. Dogs are valued for their sense of smell and have been trained to detect narcotics, explosives, agricultural products, and flammable and volatile liquids. Border guards us dogs to sniff narcotics, explosives, contraband, and even hiding or smuggled people, trying to illegally pass through borders. The tasks performed by dogs include searching passengers, vehicles, aircraft, ships and cargo for bombs, drugs and agricultural contraband at borders, ports, and airports, as well as at crime scenes or on regular patrol. Although dogs have been used in police work for years, primarily for patrol duty, their use in detecting narcotics gained widespread acceptance only around 1980. Dogs trained to sniff out narcotics are now considered a necessity in drug enforcement.
They track and capture fleeing criminals or escaped prisoners. Dogs can also pick-up scent from a crime scene and track persons who were at that site. Such dogs cannot only track the suspects but are trained to tackle them as well. Working as a team with police dogs help hunt down and capture criminal suspects. Besides patrolling and narcotics detection, dogs are used in many types of police work, including detection of explosives and flammable liquids, crowd control and manhunts. They are excellent at tracking suspects and missing persons, and add muscle to law enforcement personnel in controlling crowds. Dogs are used for tracking a suspect, missing person or lost child.
On patrol, police dogs track, control, apprehend, or attack suspects and are used to investigate crime scenes. Dogs can also pick-up scent from a crime scene and track persons who were at that site. The tasks performed by dogs include searching passengers, vehicles, aircraft, ships and cargo for bombs, drugs and agricultural contraband at borders, ports, and airports, as well as at crime scenes or on regular patrol. They therefore are used to search anywhere they are needed, including crime scenes, fires, border crossings, vehicles, airplanes, airports, and boats.
Police also use dogs to track and apprehend criminals and for crowd control. On patrol, police dogs track, control, apprehend, or attack suspects and are used to investigate crime scenes. They also detect bombs, and find missing persons and criminals often in easily overlooked places.
Besides patrolling and narcotics detection, dogs are used in many types of police work, including detection of explosives and flammable liquids, crowd control and manhunts. 20 The dogs serve several functions.
They are also used for crowd control against rioters or unruly protesters. Dogs are used for crowd control in such places as demonstrations, sporting events, and riots.
They are also used for crowd control against rioters or unruly protesters. Dogs augment control of protestors and prisoners.
The tasks performed by dogs include searching passengers, vehicles, aircraft, ships and cargo for bombs, drugs and agricultural contraband at borders, ports, and airports, as well as at crime scenes or on regular patrol. Dogs are used in airports for the same activities, inspecting airplanes, passengers and luggage. They are used by border patrol officers and customs officials to sniff out evidence of drugs aboard ships, airplanes, trains, trucks, and automobiles. They therefore are used to search anywhere they are needed, including crime scenes, fires, border crossings, vehicles, airplanes, airports, and boats.

Airport security officers use drug-sniffing dogs to detect drugs in bags, suitcases, parcels, or on passengers. Consequently, dogs are used by Customs officials at border crossings and by narcotics enforcement officers and by those charged with airport and airline safety. These include police departments, highway patrols, fire departments, sheriff departments, and airport security.
One prison uses dogs in the prison to patrol with the guards and to track any escapees. City and county police agencies, customs departments, fire departments, the Secret Service, highway patrol, border patrol, military bases and some prisons in the US and many other countries use dogs to help in law enforcement work. They have been used to pacify unruly British soccer fans and they accompany guards patrolling an overcrowded San Diego prison. Many U.S. city, county, state and federal police, fire and correctional departments use dogs for the above mentioned tasks. Prison officials use guard dogs and tracker dogs for patrols and to search for escaped prisoners. Prison guards use German shepherds for crowd control and to track escaped convicts.

On the milder side, in the interest of public relations in the US, K-9 officers will demonstrate police dog skills for students in public schools. When not on patrol, many police dogs perform public relations duties in schools, senior citizen homes and hospitals.
Large dogs are preferred because they provide a more imposing presence but small dogs also have a strong sense of smell and are therefore useful, especially if access to a small, confined area is required. Some smaller dogs are used, especially for drug detection in small, confined spaces such as airplanes and boats.

Robots helped to carry out hip replacements, prostate operations and brain surgery. Robotic assistants are used in surgery helping with hip replacements, prostate operations, and even brain surgery. They assist surgeons in delicate operations on hips and hernias, bones and brains.
Robots change computer tapes; staff a library; and handle, pack and palletize food ration boxes. Corporate IT departments use robots for loading and unloading memory tapes. They retrieve and reshelf library books and computer tapes.
Other newer industrial uses include glass making and abrading denim jeans. Robotics is for water-jet cutting plastics and in glass making.
Portable robots are used for retail display, party games for children, and museum-robotics shows. Androids, robots resembling humans, are used in entertainment and may be used increasingly in stores as attention-getters and information dispensers. Robots now are available for children's parties, are being offered as mannequins for department stores and advertising, and are wax singers in the Rock Hall of Fame. Robots entertain at children's' parties and amusement parks, and as mannequins in stores, and malls.
Medical uses include robotic arms that allow a disabled person to feed himself. Robots can feed and provide other personal assistance to the disabled. In the medical profession, there is a robotic system for producing cloned cells for genetics research, another for assisting surgeons in a wide range of surgeries, and a robotic arm with a contoured spoon has been developed for the disabled who are unable to feed themselves. Robots have been made that can feed disabled patients. Severely disabled persons eat more comfortably when fed by a robotic spoon. A robotic arm was developed to enable severely disabled people to feed themselves.
The London-based charity, Imperial Cancer Research Fund developed a robotic system to help scientists produce the huge numbers of cloned cells required for genetics research. In 1994, a British group developed a robotic system that helps scientists produce the huge numbers of cloned cells required for genetic research. A robotic system is helping scientists produce cloned cells for genetics research.

In the medical profession, there is a robotic system for producing cloned cells for genetics research, another for assisting surgeons in a wide range of surgeries, and a robotic arm with a contoured spoon has been developed for the disabled who are unable to feed themselves.
The rise of robots focused initially on the automobile industry but its applications are expanding into new markets such as health care, precision engineering, food industry, materials handling and packaging. The most common use for robots is the manufacture of automobiles in routine assembly tasks.
Robots do dirty work, such as cleaning up toxic chemicals on the ocean floor; precisely applying paint and dangerous chemicals; and conducting deep sea oil exploration, drilling and pipeline construction. That, along with advances in precision metal cutting, spray painting, and even final assembly continue to make the auto industry a leading robot user. In the automotive industry, new robotics applications include engine assembly, final assembly work, and paint spraying. The motor industry, in fact, has extended its robotic development beyond spot welding into engine assembly, paint spraying, transfers of cockpits, applying adhesive sealants, fitting glass into apertures, inserting seats, mounting wheels, completion and refitting of doors and tailpipes, and final assembly work. Citroen uses robots for painting and final assembly of cars including installation of glass fittings and sealants. Increased uses of robotics in vehicle manufacturing include automatic-arc welding, welding tank turrets, painting, water-jet cutting, final body assembly, and engine assembly using smaller editions.

By the year 2050, the world population is expected to double from 5.7 bn to some 10.6 bn. Population Fund report projects that by 2050 the world population will have grown from 1994's 5.7 billion to stabilize at 10 billion (if population growth rates continue to decline as expected), 7.8 billion (if rates decline even just a little faster than expected) or 12.5 billion (if today's rates stop falling). United Nations population projections in 1993 were for the world population to double from the current 5.5 billion to 11 billion by 2050. That is double the present 5.5 billion.
Yet, the serious economic disadvantages to nations and individuals of over-population have driven Islamic Iran, Egypt, Albania, Tunisia (which abolished polygamy), and largely Catholic Spain, Italy, Mexico, Brazil and other Latin American countries to remove government subsidies encouraging large families, start family planning (particularly contraception); women's health and education; and women's emancipation and employment efforts, to reduce fertility rates, as have the U.K., Germany, India, China, Mauritius, the Philippines, Zimbabwe and Botswana. Wherever governments have encouraged family planning, birth rates have dropped. In all of these countries success was achieved through education about family planning and availability of contraceptive devises. The major factors affecting lower growth rates around the world are: increased literacy rights granted to women, family planning programs, and higher employment. Factors influencing growth rate are that women have more educational opportunity, access to family planning and methods of contraception.
Moslem countries such as Indonesia, Iran, Egypt and especially, Tunisia have slowed birth rates. A government program and contraception access is starting to slow Iran's rate. The successful lowering of birth rates in countries such as China, India, Iran, Tunisia, Egypt, and Brazil are worth noting.

By 1994 the population growth rate had declined to 1.8 percent. The fertility rate in Iran has dropped significantly due to a government program for population control. Iran's clerics, who initially encouraged large families, now encourage family planning, which has dropped their growth rate from 3.9% to 2.3%.
A sharp slowdown has also occurred in Brazil and other Latin American countries. Nearly 95% of the projected rise would come from developing countries, despite successes that many Asian and Latin American countries have had in bringing down their birth rates. Birth rates in Latin American countries have fallen dramatically, with growth rates under 2%.
Population continues to grow in sub-Saharan Africa, where few use contraception and six children are born per woman. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest fertility rates, averaging more than 6 children per woman. Sub-Saharan Africa has fertility rates over 6 per woman.

The successful lowering of birth rates in countries such as China, India, Iran, Tunisia, Egypt, and Brazil are worth noting. It has cut the annual growth in population from 2.8 percent in 1980 to 2.2 percent in 1994. Countries which have seen birth rates decline include Egypt, China, India, Tunisia, and Brazil. The emancipation of women, along with state-controlled family programs and the increasing use of contraceptives in Tunisia and Egypt, has cut the population growth rate in those countries nearly in half.

The Mexican government is battling huge population growth in a strongly Catholic country. Although a Catholic country, Mexico is trying to limit growth and 48% of the women use contraception.
The emancipation of women, along with state-controlled family programs and the increasing use of contraceptives in Tunisia and Egypt, has cut the population growth rate in those countries nearly in half. In Tunisia, for example, government efforts to educate women and bring them into the workforce helped lower birth rates to 1.9 % per woman. Women being educated, working, and using contraception have slowed Tunisia's rate, while Singapore's dropped too sharply for the government.
The policy has had a dramatic effect, with the fertility rate falling to around 1.9 from 2.25 by 1994. China's "one child" policy has kept population growth down to the same 1.9% as in western Europe.
Population growth rates have been slowed in virtually all parts of the world except for sub-Saharan Africa countries and even a few countries there such as Zimbabwe and Botswana have seen a decline. Thus, the rate of growth, world-wide, is slowing but still about a billion people will be added each year by mid-21st century.
Catholic countries with large populations and high birth rates such as Brazil, Mexico, and the Philippines are beginning to see slowing in birth rates. Yet, the serious economic disadvantages to nations and individuals of over-population have driven Islamic Iran, Egypt, Albania, Tunisia (which abolished polygamy), and largely Catholic Spain, Italy, Mexico, Brazil and other Latin American countries to remove government subsidies encouraging large families, start family planning (particularly contraception); women's health and education; and women's emancipation and employment efforts, to reduce fertility rates, as have the U.K., Germany, India, China, Mauritius, the Philippines, Zimbabwe and Botswana. The program succeeded in lowering the growth rate from 2.4 percent to 2.1 percent in the first half of 1994.
Some belief systems significantly influence global population rate increases, especially in traditional Catholic and Islamic countries, which favor large families and discourage women's reproductive rights. Economics, religion, and women's education are major factors that influence population growth or decline.
The goal is one child per family, and financial penalties are used to achieve it. China, with one abortion for every two live births, imposed severe penalties for urban families wanting more than one child and aggressively promoted sterilization (as did Brazil). The policy in China is to limit couples to one child through financial incentives and aggressively promoting contraception.
The policy in China is to limit couples to one child through financial incentives and aggressively promoting contraception. The program strongly promotes contraception; abortion is widely available.
Since 1956, a policy of family planning has been in place in Tunisia. The emancipation of women, along with state-controlled family programs and the increasing use of contraceptives in Tunisia and Egypt, has cut the population growth rate in those countries nearly in half.
The fertility rate in Iran has dropped significantly due to a government program for population control. A government program and contraception access is starting to slow Iran's rate.
The major factors affecting lower growth rates around the world are: increased literacy rights granted to women, family planning programs, and higher employment. Yet, the serious economic disadvantages to nations and individuals of over-population have driven Islamic Iran, Egypt, Albania, Tunisia (which abolished polygamy), and largely Catholic Spain, Italy, Mexico, Brazil and other Latin American countries to remove government subsidies encouraging large families, start family planning (particularly contraception); women's health and education; and women's emancipation and employment efforts, to reduce fertility rates, as have the U.K., Germany, India, China, Mauritius, the Philippines, Zimbabwe and Botswana.
The poor and Catholic Philippines continues with a high rate, which the government is just beginning to address.. However, growth rates in Mexico and the Philippines remain high at 2.4% Africa's growth rate of 2.9% is the highest in the world.
The lessening demand for tin has resulted in many changes in Southeast Asian countries, especially in Malaysia. Tin mining in south-east Asia has been steadily declining because of rising production costs and record low tin prices.
Prices for tin fell dramatically and tin mining operations, particularly those involved in high cost hard rock mining, were forced to close down or cut back operation. Factors leading to tin mining decline include: depleted high-grade tin reserves and high production costs outside Indonesia, Vietnam, China, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, and Portugal; labor shortages and rising wages; Russia becoming a net tin exporter; tin market arbitrage; a strong Malaysian currency against the U.S. dollar; glass, aluminum and plastic packaging; thinner tin coatings on steel cans; and decreased tin-lead solder use. Tin mining in south-east Asia has been steadily declining because of rising production costs and record low tin prices.
Prices are also declining because materials like glass, aluminum, and plastic are replacing tin in the packaging industry. Factors leading to tin mining decline include: depleted high-grade tin reserves and high production costs outside Indonesia, Vietnam, China, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, and Portugal; labor shortages and rising wages; Russia becoming a net tin exporter; tin market arbitrage; a strong Malaysian currency against the U.S. dollar; glass, aluminum and plastic packaging; thinner tin coatings on steel cans; and decreased tin-lead solder use. Also glass, aluminum, and plastic began replacing tin as containers and the tin coating on tin-plated steel cans became thinner. Furthermore, the demand for tin for use in food storage was being replaced by glass, aluminum, and plastic. Several factors explain the slump: the 1985 buffer stock operations collapse leaving 100,000 tons of stockpiled tin on the market; China's export emergence and the Soviet Union's absence from the import market; the US Defense Logistics Agency's selling of tin from stockpiles and the increasing use of aluminum.

Indonesia cut tin production costs 25% to become the top seller. It now has risen to top place among the world's producers behind China. Indonesia, the third largest tin producer, is attempting to maintain its domestic tin mining.
In 1993, Malaysia Mining Corporation, one of the world's biggest producers, closed its tin mines. Gopeng, Malaysia's largest hydraulic tin mining operation closed in 1992, as did the Sungei Lembing mines and the Malaysia Mining Corp. in 1993.
After World War II, when the Japanese closed and flooded some mines, production resumed with Malaysian production in 1960 between 60,000 and 70,000 tons. In the 1960s, Malaysia was producing between 60,000 and 70,000 tons of tin annually and employing over 200,000 workers in the industry.
Meanwhile, Malaysia has moved away from commodity production and put its capital in modern technologies, electronics, tourism, and real estate. High wages and the rapid growth of other industries pushed tin off that nation's priority list.
In 1857 rich deposits were found on the Malay Peninsula and the industry flourished with British concessions and thousands of Chinese immigrant workers. The British initially developed the industry, employing hundreds of thousands of Chinese immigrants. The British began mining tin in the late 19th century in what is now Malaysia.
In the mid-1980s 40,000 workers produced 60,000 tons of tin in Malaysia. By the early 1980s, Malaysia was producing 60,000 tons of tin in concentrate per year while earning between M Dollars 32 and M Dollars 34 kilogram for tin exports. In the early 1980s, Malaysia was producing more than 60,000 tons of tin a year.
Factors leading to tin mining decline include: depleted high-grade tin reserves and high production costs outside Indonesia, Vietnam, China, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, and Portugal; labor shortages and rising wages; Russia becoming a net tin exporter; tin market arbitrage; a strong Malaysian currency against the U.S. dollar; glass, aluminum and plastic packaging; thinner tin coatings on steel cans; and decreased tin-lead solder use. The uses of tin have also been declining: aluminum now has the biggest share of the market for beverage cans and the use of tin in solders has been buoyant.
Beginning in 1985 too much tin had been stockpiled in many countries in the world and was released on the market. Tin producers suffered a worldwide crisis in 1985. In 1985 the International Tin Council stopped price supports and dumped 100,000 tons of tin, crushing prices. Several factors explain the slump: the 1985 buffer stock operations collapse leaving 100,000 tons of stockpiled tin on the market; China's export emergence and the Soviet Union's absence from the import market; the US Defense Logistics Agency's selling of tin from stockpiles and the increasing use of aluminum. Historic Southeast Asian tin producers (Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand) were members of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC), which kept prices supported until 1985 when turmoil struck the industry.
The failure of the ATPC to enforce production quotas, increased production by non- ATPC members such as China and Brazil as well as the entry of new producers Peru, Portugal, and Vietnam, and the US Defense Logistics Agency disposing of large amounts of tin, all served to undermine the tin industry in Southeast Asia. But Brazil and China were not members. By 1993 China and Brazil were major tin producers and, as non-members of the ATCP, were stockpiling and exporting vast amounts of tin, driving the price down.
The Soviet-bloc had been a big importer. The collapse of the former Soviet Union, once a substantial consumer of tin, added to the producers' difficulties. Several factors explain the slump: the 1985 buffer stock operations collapse leaving 100,000 tons of stockpiled tin on the market; China's export emergence and the Soviet Union's absence from the import market; the US Defense Logistics Agency's selling of tin from stockpiles and the increasing use of aluminum.
In the early 1990s, the Malaysia tin industry began a sharp decline -- down to M Dollars 12 kilogram. By 1994, Malaysia was no longer a major producer.
By 1993 China and Brazil were major tin producers and, as non-members of the ATCP, were stockpiling and exporting vast amounts of tin, driving the price down. During this same period, three countries that had lower labor costs, China, Indonesia, and Brazil raised output of tin to become bigger producers than Malaysia. China raised tin exports. China and Brazil have increased tin exports, frustrating attempts to reduce global stockpiles.

Also glass, aluminum, and plastic began replacing tin as containers and the tin coating on tin-plated steel cans became thinner.
Low cost mines in Indonesia, Brazil, and China outsold Malaysia, raising surpluses and lowering prices. Indonesia, China and Brazil are now bigger tin producers than Malaysia.
Prices began dropping soon thereafter and efforts by the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) to limit production to boost prices were unsuccessful. Historic Southeast Asian tin producers (Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand) were members of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC), which kept prices supported until 1985 when turmoil struck the industry. Quotas on tin exports introduced by the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) did not have much effect on pricing.
In 1993 more Malaysian mines closed when government disincentives replaced subsidies. The Malaysian government, concluding that tin was no longer strategically important, decided to no longer subsidize mining development.

The world's most extensively developed underground tin mine, stretching over 4,000 acres, was developed by Cornish miners 100 years ago at Sungei Lembing. It was originally developed by Cornish tin miners 100 years ago.
From before 1992 through 1994 the UK's Tory Prime Minister adamantly resisted calls by MPs of the miniscule Wales Nationalist Party (Plaid Cymru) for devolution of British rule to a fully self-governing Wales within the European Community. Conservatives were strongly opposed, and the policy of Plaid Cymru, the nationalist party, was to bypass an assembly and go directly for independence within the European community. The Welsh nationalists want to bypass an assembly and go directly for an independent Welsh republican state it Europe. Those who speak the language support Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party whose policy is to bypass an assembly and go for an independent Wales within the European community. Plaid Cymru wants full independence with a Welsh parliament.
Plaid had only four MPs from 38 Welsh districts, who opposed self-rule in a 1979 referendum four-to-one. Many say that formation of assemblies would only create an expensive restructuring of current local services, (eight counties would be changed into 37 district councils,) and actually threaten local democracy. The government does plan to restructure local government in Wales in which eight county and 37 district councils would be replaced by 21 unitary authorities. The government intends to set up 21 new authorities to replace the eight counties and 37 districts in Wales. White papers recommended government reforms, which replaced the eight county councils and 37 district councils with 21 unitary authorities.
Implementation of the local government reform will take place in April 1995. Plans were to create shadow councils for Wales and have them operational by the spring of 1995. It intended that these councils should take over in April 1995.
Support for the devolution of Wales generally followed party lines. Proposals for the governing of Wales split more along party lines than national divisions.
Wales is following in the footsteps of Scotland and moving towards increased support for an elected assembly with devolved powers along the lines advocated by the Labor party. Wales is following Scotland, and moving towards a call for an elected assembly with devolved powers, as advocated by the Labour Party. It will establish an elected Welsh assembly, with law-making and financial powers, to replace the current two-tier system of county and district councils with single-purpose, unitary authorities.
Within the first year of a Labor government devolution would be expected and a Welsh assembly granted. A Labour conference promised a Welsh assembly within the first year of a Labour government. The Labor party, however, anxious for Plaid Cymru support, has promised to set up a Welsh assembly within its first year of government. With only three members in parliament, they seek support from Labour who has promised an independent Welsh Assembly.
By 1994, a strong Welsh devolution movement had developed. By 1994 Plaid Cymru demanded equal rights with Scotland for self-determination.

Labour has committed to the creation of a Welsh assembly, and party leader Tony Blair set out proposals for devolution, setting off a constitutional battle with the Tories. Tony Blair, the Labor party leader, planned to pursue his intentions to set up a Welsh assembly. In December 1994, Tony Blair, Labour leader, and probable prime minister after an upcoming election, signaled a constitutional battle with the Tories by setting out proposals for devolution for Scotland and Wales.

From before 1992 through 1994 the UK's Tory Prime Minister adamantly resisted calls by MPs of the miniscule Wales Nationalist Party (Plaid Cymru) for devolution of British rule to a fully self-governing Wales within the European Community. In 1992, the British prime minister, John Major, rejected a call for a Welsh parliament with devolved powers by a Welsh member of parliament.
He reminded them that on an earlier occasion when there appeared to be a majority in favor of devolution, a referendum had produced a contrary result. Major reminded him that results of an earlier referendum, in 1978, showed that only 18 percent of Welsh voters favored a parliament.
At that time, the Welsh Nationalist Party, Plaid Cymru, launched its manifesto urging self-government for Wales within the European Community (EU) noting that it was not just a distant aim but an urgent necessity and essential for democracy. The most recent push for self-rule for Wales became strong in 1992.
Plaid had only four MPs from 38 Welsh districts, who opposed self-rule in a 1979 referendum four-to-one. In the 1979 referendum on devolution, the vote was four to one against an assembly.
The conservatives in Wales are opposed to devolution and believe that a strong Welsh Office with a cabinet minister is best. Conservatives were strongly opposed, and the policy of Plaid Cymru, the nationalist party, was to bypass an assembly and go directly for independence within the European community. Also, conservatives and business people look east to London. Conservatives oppose any form of devolution, and want to maintain a strong Welsh Office with a cabinet minister, believing that would produce the best results for Wales.
Implementation was postponed until at least 1995. In 1993 these plans were delayed for one year with shadow council elections scheduled for 1995 and in place in 1996.

Single-sex education appears to have definite advantages for girls. Even though research shows that single-sex education is beneficial for girls, the few women's colleges in the U.S. are struggling. Single-sex education is superior for girls. There is statistically significant evidence that girls do benefit more from single-sex schools than coeducational. But girls perform better from age 16 on in same-sex academic environments, than in co-ed settings.
Both girls and boys can forge close friendships and camaraderie in single sex institutions. A minor concern would be that the camaraderie boys enjoy in singe-sex schools would be lost in coed schools, once they begin competing for the attentions of female classmates.
Only one in the top 30 schools was co-educational. In the UK, only one in the top 30 independent schools is coeducational, and 25 of the top 30 state schools are single-sex. Of the top 30 most highly ranked schools in the nation based on test scores, only one was coed. In the United Kingdom single-sex schools are the ones performing better academically with only one school in the top 30 being coeducational before the age of 16.
Another advantage is that students get accustomed to working with the other gender, a more natural situation and one that will be experienced in the workforce. Many supporters of co-ed schools do so because it is more like the real world environment where both sexes mingle.
From1960 to 1990, the number of women's colleges dropped from 298 to 94. They went co-ed, merged with men's schools or closed.
The big argument for single-sex education is that you do not have to conform to gender stereotype. A highest-ranked UK school headmistress summed it up: "... 16-year-old girls work a lot harder than boys," especially where they "don't have to conform to gender stereotypes", "not just in science and maths, but in behaviour generally," when they "believe that they have a real chance of entering a career with their academic qualifications, and so they are working for them." An untested, anecdotally proffered advantage of same-sex schools is that students are less distracted from studies if emerging sexual-tensions are avoided at least in the classroom. Headmistress Joan Clancy said, "The big argument for single-sex education is that you don't have to conform to gender stereotypes". They may feel freer to take "traditional male" studies and do not feel forced to defer to the boys as they can feel in coeducational classes. In addition, girls are often intimidated by the boys, don't take on leadership roles, and fall into the stereotypical gender roles of low interest in math and science. A big argument for single-sex education is that students don't have to conform to gender stereotypes. Single-sex schools, make it easier for girls to challenge the stereotype that math and science are male preserves.
In addition, girls are often intimidated by the boys, don't take on leadership roles, and fall into the stereotypical gender roles of low interest in math and science. In single-sex schools, girls often excel in these subjects.
Generally speaking, single-sex schools have tended to produce higher levels of academic achievement. Ratings of schools by the Financial Times of London consistently show that single-sex schools rate higher academically. In 1992-1994, UK testing of school performance showed that "a disproportionate share of the best schools, academically, are single-sex," both public and private (sectarian or secular). In the United Kingdom single-sex schools are the ones performing better academically with only one school in the top 30 being coeducational before the age of 16.
Boys and girls do not mature at the same rate, especially around the age of 16, a point that leads many to believe that same-sex schools are advantageous. FT does not present these findings as showing that single-sex education is inherently better, but these findings have been traditionally seen in England as an advantage of single-sex schooling.
Educators believe that girls flourish in classrooms without boys, who tend to be less mature, and benefit from having fewer distractions. They are able to study without intimidation and with fewer distractions. It is argued that separation of the sexes allows for less distraction in the classroom.

An untested, anecdotally proffered advantage of same-sex schools is that students are less distracted from studies if emerging sexual-tensions are avoided at least in the classroom. This means for women not just in science and mathematics but also in behavior generally.
The women are more likely to graduate and obtain advanced degrees. Women in single-sex colleges are more likely to graduate and obtain advanced degrees than those attending coed schools. Women at single-sex colleges are more likely to graduate and obtain advanced degrees than women at co-ed schools.

When the Soviet yoke lifted from Czechoslovakia, historic nationalistic feelings arose again. Czechoslovakia's split up was the result of growing deep-rooted Slovak nationalism following the collapse of the Soviet bloc. The dominant Slovak political party under demagogic Vladimir Meciar called for greater autonomy consistent with Slovakia's increasingly sense of nationalism.
President Vaclav Havel was not reelected on July 6. His party pushed for greater economic and political autonomy for Slovakia and prevented the re-election of Vaclav Havel. By 1992, the polarization of politics between nationalists in Slovakia and market reformers in the Czech lands, as well as the defeat of Vaclav Havel, a strong advocate for the union, had put the federation of Czechs and Slovaks at risk. Elections, in which Havel failed to be reelected president, brought to power Czech Prime Minister Klaus and Slovak Prime Minister Meciar.
In early June 1992, the two leaders agreed to form an interim federal government, with equal representation for Slovaks and Czechs to oversee the separation of the state. A new interim federal government was authorized to prepare for the smooth functioning of two sovereign states. The two agreed to form an interim federal government, equally Czech and Slovak, to oversee the dissolution of Czechoslovakia and an orderly transition of federal powers to both Czech and Slovak national parliaments. The two parliaments passed a joint resolution authorizing an interim government leading to separation on January 1, 1993, which the Czechoslovak parliament endorsed.

Inflation was over 25%. At the end of its first year of independence its economy was in recession with inflation and unemployment at high levels. One year later, Slovakia's economy remains deeply in recession, with inflation over 25% and unemployment on the rise. Unemployment was high, foreign investments low, and inflation above 25%.
One year later, Slovakia's economy remains deeply in recession, with inflation over 25% and unemployment on the rise. Since the breakup, Slovakia has faced economic stress, higher unemployment, and some political upheaval since many of its citizens were not in favor of complete independence. Unemployment was high, foreign investments low, and inflation above 25%. At the end of its first year of independence its economy was in recession with inflation and unemployment at high levels.
Slovakia's heavy industries were uneconomically geared to the Soviet market and it has yet to recover. Slovakia still had stronge ties to the East, it's factories producing heavy goods geared to Soviet markets. Slovakia had a concentration of uneconomic heavy industries geared to the Soviet market.
The Czech Republic, having been more industrialized, needs to restructure and develop its infrastructure, but is now free to pursue its own accelerated drive toward a free market society. The Czechs, representing 2/3s of the country's population, were highly industrialized and Western looking with strong ties to Germany.
Following the downfall of Communism there was a superficial unity in Czechoslovakia, but disputes began. In the two years after the collapse of communism in Prague, the Czech and Slovak republics were unable to agree on a political basis for future coexistence in one country. Czechoslovakia's split up was the result of growing deep-rooted Slovak nationalism following the collapse of the Soviet bloc. When the Soviet yoke lifted from Czechoslovakia, historic nationalistic feelings arose again.
In Czechoslovakia's 1992 elections, Slovaks voted to seek a looser confederation between the Czech and Slovak republics. In June 1992 Czech politicians who wanted a rapid market reform and integration into the rest of Europe were elected, while the elected Slovaks were members of the nationalist-populist and separatist parties and were calling for greater autonomy. But only six months earlier, most Slovaks went into the crucial general elections of June 1992 intending to negotiate a new and looser union with their richer Czech cousins, but not to be divorced from them. In the election of 1992, the Slovak nationalist Movement for a Democratic Slovakia led by charismatic Vladamir Meciar, won a large percentage of the vote. The 1992 elections in Czechoslovakia defined the directions that the Czechs and the Slovaks were taking.
Six weeks after the separation, each country had it's own currency. After separation, currencies split.
The Czech republic had a skilled work force with wages low, making the country attractive for foreign investment. Czechs took Czechoslovakia's foreign and domestic debt, but their rapidly privatizing economy invited EC investments, supplies and markets. The Czech Republic, on the other hand, has been blessed with increased prosperity, one of the lowest levels of unemployment in Europe, substantial foreign investment, and a thriving tourist trade.
The Czechs voted for rapid market reforms and integration into Europe under the leadership of Vaclav Klaus and the Slovaks voted for the party of Vladimir Meciar and its avowedly separatist agenda. In June 1992 Czech politicians who wanted a rapid market reform and integration into the rest of Europe were elected, while the elected Slovaks were members of the nationalist-populist and separatist parties and were calling for greater autonomy. The Republic is working toward rapid integration into the European market.

The amicable separation became official January 1, 1993 after which the two began moving rapidly apart. On January 1, 1993, the agreed upon separation was official. Two new states were born on January 1, 1993. On New Year's day, 1993, Slovaks sloughed off a thousand year subservience to Hungary and seven decades as the junior partner in Czechoslovakia and celebrated the birth of a sovereign, independent republic.
Free movement of goods and people was permitted. No customs officials or border restrictions were deemed necessary.
He turned down the looser federation proposed by Vladimir Meciar, the Slovak leader. In Czechoslovakia's 1992 elections, Slovaks voted to seek a looser confederation between the Czech and Slovak republics.
Unemployment was high, foreign investments low, and inflation above 25%. Slovakia's slow privatization discouraged investors.
Poland and Hungary created free-trade zones with both republics. In December both regions signed free-trade agreements that included Poland and Hungary.

A federal judge sentenced political extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr. to 15 years in prison on mail and tax fraud convictions. Political extremist Lyndon LaRouche was sentenced to 15 years in prison on a mail and tax fraud conviction that could have brought him 65 years. In 1989 Lyndon LaRouche drew a 15-year sentence, while Barry Minkow got 25 years and a $25 million restitution order.

Savings and loan collapse criminals began to draw heavy jail sentences such as 20, 15, and 12 years. However, two businessmen whose fraud resulted in the collapse of a savings and loan were sentenced to 15 and 12 years and ordered to make restitution of $6.8 million.
Some judges stated that they imposed harsh sentences to set an example to others. Other judges have imposed harsh penalties, stating their hope that they would act as deterrents.
Some judges have issued tough sentences, explicitly calling them a "deterrent" to other would-be criminals, such as "The sentence will send a message to other savings and loan owners that white-collar crime doesn't pay". Some judges stated that they imposed harsh sentences to set an example to others. Judges are increasingly imposing stiff sentences and levying stiff fines as deterrents. Other judges have imposed harsh penalties, stating their hope that they would act as deterrents. In some of the longest term sentencing, judges are sending the message to would-be fraud criminals that the criminal system will no longer coddle white-collar offenders. Judges were calling white-collar crimes "heinous", denouncing liars, and imposing high fines as a deterrent, especially for those guilty of insider trading.
Also, there has been growing sentiment among judges that white-collar criminals should be treated the same as other criminals, especially in the light of savings and loan scandals emerging in the mid-1980s. During the late 1980s and early 1990s there were many cases of financial crime brought to trial (in both the state and federal courts) including three very high profile cases: Leona Helmsley, accused of tax evasion, Michael Milkin, accused of insider trading on Wall Street, and the looting of the North American Savings & Loan Company most notably by Janet Faye McKinzie. But several cases in 1989 and 1990 illustrate the opposite: Barry Minkow, who built a fraudulent $100-million empire, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for fraud and conspiracy, plus payment of $26 million in restitution.

Janet Faye McKinzie was convicted of looting the now-defunct North America Savings & Loan.
Although there is no consistent pattern in sentencing, there was some tendency to impose harsher penalties on financial criminals than in previous years. Some judges have issued tough sentences, explicitly calling them a "deterrent" to other would-be criminals, such as "The sentence will send a message to other savings and loan owners that white-collar crime doesn't pay". Judges are increasingly imposing stiff sentences and levying stiff fines as deterrents. In recent years, however, they are becoming increasingly severe in their sentencing in the wake of government and private business concerns about judges being soft on "white-collar" workers.
Having a widely recognized name in the business world has not saved Leona Helmsley, Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken from doing time. In all three cases cited above, penalties included jail time of several years with no chance of parole in the first two to three years, financial penalties, restitution to those cheated, and community service hours.
In all three cases cited above, penalties included jail time of several years with no chance of parole in the first two to three years, financial penalties, restitution to those cheated, and community service hours. Increasingly harsh sentences for some of those found guilty have included a multi-year prison term, plus several years of probation during which community service is to be performed, plus a stiff fine and also restitution may be required.

In 1989 Lyndon LaRouche drew a 15-year sentence, while Barry Minkow got 25 years and a $25 million restitution order.
A federal judge sentenced a stunned Michael Milken to 10 years in prison. Michael Milken-- the junk bond king--drew 10 years in jail, 3 years probation, 1,800 hours of community service, and $600 million in fines.
Leona Helmsley, the self-proclaimed queen of a luxury hotel chain, was sentenced to four years in federal prison and fined $7.1 million for criminal tax offenses. Leona Helmsly was given a 4-year sentence, a $7.1 million restitution, 3 years probation, 750 hours of public service, and ordered to pay her taxes.
Judges can impose any combination of prison time, fines, court costs, costs of incarceration, restitution, probation, suspended sentences and community service. In most cases, sentences involve a combination of imprisonment, fines, and restitution.
But other judges' tough verbal warnings have not matched their more lenient sentences. Not all got heavy sentences.
Indian communities have greater than average occurrences of such problems as drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, teen pregnancy, poor education, and unemployment. There is poor health care and higher than average death rates from alcohol, diabetes, suicide, and accidents. The Indian death rate is 35 times that of the rest of the population with high incidence of alcoholism, diabetes, accidents and suicides.
Problems facing Indians and the reservation system include decreased funding for Indian programs; repeal of affirmative action laws; Indian culture and local regulations conflicting with federal or state laws, tribes not being fully recognized and having no access to federal funds; and banks unwilling to give Indians home loans that are backed by land held in trust. The nature of the land -- "held in trust" -- effectively shuts the Indians out of conventional home loan processes.

Federal aid programs are inadequate and impacted by outdated maps and census figures. Federal funding is inadequate to satisfy the staggering needs of reservations.
Privileges of tribal sovereignty include unique hunting and fishing rights, and the ability to sell gas and cigarettes tax-free, set zooming, and ban or sell alcohol. The system also recognizes Indian fishing and hunting rights and frees residents from state taxes, while providing the right to vote in local, state, and federal elections. Their sovereignty allows them to run casinos and enjoy extraordinary fishing and hunting rights. They can determine local zoning, fishing and hunting rules; ban alcohol; and open casinos.

At least half of U.S. Indians live in poverty. Half of Native American Indians on reservations live in poverty with poor health care, substandard housing, and limited computer access. At least half the Indian population lives in poverty.
Tribal authorities deal with minor crimes but turn to federal help for more serious crime. The FBI or Bureau of Indian Affairs is responsible for serious crimes.
Minor crimes by Indians come under tribal authority. Tribal authorities deal with minor crimes but turn to federal help for more serious crime.
Indians are over twice as often victims of violent crimes, 60% of which are perpetrated by whites. Continuing prejudice against Indians results in drunken attacks by whites.

Indian communities have greater than average occurrences of such problems as drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, teen pregnancy, poor education, and unemployment.
But some are troubled by legal battles with states that either outlaw gambling or want to tax the profits. Casinos aren't always successful and are often opposed by localities that don't want local gambling or competitors who fear untaxed competition.
On the positive side the reservation system has helped preserve Indian culture, to recognize Indian sovereignty and to provide federal funds for roads, schools, clinics and a welfare system. The federal government pays for reservation clinics, schools, and welfare.
Life on most Indian reservations is marked by extreme poverty, drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, failed education, rising crime rates and high unemployment. Drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, poor education, teen births, and lack of jobs creates unemployment 10 times the national average. Indian communities have greater than average occurrences of such problems as drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, teen pregnancy, poor education, and unemployment.
Wetlands, called earth's kidney, are important in filtering pollutants, regulating climate, conserving water, preventing erosion, controlling floods, and preserving biodiversity. They play important roles in filtering and cleansing water, preventing soil erosion, preventing soil and water pollution, serving as a reservoir for flood waters and in harboring fish, shellfish, wild plants, migratory birds, waterfowl and tiny organisms essential to the food chain. Wetlands are important for flood prevention and impact climate, water preservation, soil erosion, and pollution. They play a role in controlling floods, conserving water, preventing soil-erosion, disposing of sewage, filtering of waste, adjusting the climate, and in hosting a great variety of plants and waterfowl.

They are important natural ecological systems that provide social, economic, and ecological benefits. The Wetlands are a natural ecological system sometimes called "Earth's kidney".
Even in underdeveloped countries the increase of such activities as grazing, brick-making, rice-planting, hunting, and tree-cutting have negative impacts on wetlands. Human activities threaten wetlands in many places, including Asia, Africa, and the US, where 100,000 acres per year have been lost.
In 1996 Wetlands International linked government and NGO groups to work for conservation. The launch of Wetlands International, an international conservation body, in 1996, represents a partnership between government and non-government interests with the goal of wetlands conservation. In 1996 at a follow-up Ramsar Convention conference delegates from 120 countries launched the Wetlands International.

Efforts around the world include abuse hot lines and swamp-draining prohibitions by Uganda. Active programs to protect wetlands are underway in countries as varied as China, Vietnam, India, Uganda and the United States. Countries are raising public awareness of wetlands' importance.
Efforts around the world include abuse hot lines and swamp-draining prohibitions by Uganda. In 1996 Uganda established an environmental abuse reporting hot line and banned new draining of swamps for development.
It intends setting up nature reserves for wetlands and funding wetland-related research. China established over 130 wetland nature reserves since 1982 and increased wetland protections. China has established wetland reserves and is developing a monitoring network and scientific study of wetlands, as well as programs at local government levels for educating the public about natural resources.
Once thought to be useless mud, they are now known as important as filters for water prior to entering rivers and lakes.

Human activities threaten wetlands in many places, including Asia, Africa, and the US, where 100,000 acres per year have been lost. Though precise figures are unavailable, estimates are that wetlands in the US are disappearing at the rate of about 70,000 to 100,000 acres a year. The remaining 100million acres are being depleted at the rate of 100,000 acres per year.
They play important roles in filtering and cleansing water, preventing soil erosion, preventing soil and water pollution, serving as a reservoir for flood waters and in harboring fish, shellfish, wild plants, migratory birds, waterfowl and tiny organisms essential to the food chain. They serve as a habitat for numerous varieties of flora and fauna, many of which are quite rare.

China established over 130 wetland nature reserves since 1982 and increased wetland protections. Active programs to protect wetlands are underway in countries as varied as China, Vietnam, India, Uganda and the United States. It has begun efforts on the proper use and management of wetland resources and on enforcing environmental protection standards.
The Nethrlands and Finland are funding programs in Uganda and China respectively. International help with wetland restoration has come from the Netherlands, Finland, and the World Bank.

They include acetaminophen, as Tylenol, for pain relief, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as Advil, Aleve, Motrin, and topical pain-relieving ointments. An acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) is used to treat pain alone.
Procedures which claim adherents but lack scientific support include the Jacobson resonance machine which emits a weak magnetic field, injection of steroids and the drugs hyaheronan (Hyalgan) and hylan G-F20 (Synvisk) into the knee, arthroscopic surgery, acupuncture, tai chi, and stinging nettle. Electromagnetic resonance is still being tested.
Knee and hip replacement can restore mobility. Surgery is often used relieve the pain and limited mobility of osteoarthritis.
Paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), and topical medications are for pain and inflammation. The treatment of osteoarthritis includes a number of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen.
Three new NSAIDS containing COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) inhibitors have been developed - meloxicam (Mobic), Celebra, and Vioxx. In 1999 the FDA approved a new class of Cox-2 inhibitors (Celebrex and Vioxx) which appeared to give pain relief without damage to the stomach, but it was not known whether there might be other side effects. New NSAIDS called COX-2 inhibitors, such as Celebrex and Vioxx, are being used to reduce inflammation.
No studies yet support the effectiveness of Tai chi, acupuncture, qi gong, ayurveda, alfalfa, or the drug methyl sulfonyl methane.

Nontraditional approaches used to treat osteoarthritis include acupuncture, folk remedies, such as wearing copper bracelets, and nutritional supplements, such as glucosamine, chondroitin, and certain vitamins. Studies show that vitamin C and beta-carotene reduce the risk of osteoarthritis, and vitamin E eases arthritis pain. Researchers are also looking at an antibiotic doxycycline and vitamins C and E. There is general agreement that sufferers from arthritis benefit from weight loss and exercise.
Research indicated that COX-2 drugs reduce inflammation similarly to traditional NSAIDs while causing fewer gastrointestinal side effects. They are painkillers that cut inflammation with no stomach distress.

No studies yet support the effectiveness of Tai chi, acupuncture, qi gong, ayurveda, alfalfa, or the drug methyl sulfonyl methane.
HMP-33, a ginger extract, and SAM-e also provide pain relief, seemingly without negative side effects. Research shows HMP-33 and SAM-e (S-Adenosylmethionine) give relief from pain with no negative side effects.
Nontraditional approaches used to treat osteoarthritis include acupuncture, folk remedies, such as wearing copper bracelets, and nutritional supplements, such as glucosamine, chondroitin, and certain vitamins. Nutritional supplements -- particularly glucosamine sulfate, chondroitin sulfate -- have become trendy for treating osteoarthritis.
Glucosamine and chondroitin sooth knee pain as well as ibuprophen but without side effects. US studies find them to be safe and significantly more effective than placebo.
Mercedes-Benz sport utility models included Body-Smart, a system that deactivates the front passenger-side airbag if a child is in a booster seat in the front. Side airbags or curtains, again that can be deactivated, are being installed to prevent injuries in side collusions or rollovers.
Volvo luxury models featured computerized stability and traction control, advanced antilock braking, new seats offering improved whiplash protection in rear-end crashes, and an "inflatable curtain," Volvo's version of a side airbag system to protect the driver and front passenger in side collisions. Additional interior cushioning is used to avoid head injuries and having the backrest and head restraint shift backward in a rear end collusion can provide whiplash protection.
Enforcing their use and programs to educate parents on the correct use and installation are key. DaimlerChrysler agreed to establish a permanent free service at some of its dealerships to advise parents on the correct way to install children's car seats. Some governmental units and some auto dealers are offering free advice and assistance in the proper installation of children's seats.
Crash tests, finally beginning in China, should include child dummies in the back seat. Crash tests, including tests with dummies in the rear seats provide valuable information for safety planners.
Other safety devices in limited use are reverse sensing devices to warn of the closeness of objects behind the car and sensors to warn of low tire pressure. Anti-lock brakes, computerized stability and traction control, all-wheel drive, low-tire-pressure detectors, reverse sensing systems, better suspension and handling, and blue-tint headlights all contribute to this end.
Its weakness lies in the failure of drivers and passengers to use it. Getting people to use them remains a problem, which has been addressed by installing use-sensors and enacting laws to stop and fine non-users.
Several electronic computer-controlled devices were produced to warn of or compensate for dangerous driving conditions, and record data on vehicle performance ("black box"). Finally the installation and analysis of "black boxes" that record data in the last seconds before a crash will allow engineers to better understand crashes and the causes of injuries. Researchers have suggested using "black boxes" in cars like those used in aircraft to record data pertinent to an auto crash to lead to safety improvements.
Devices were installed to prevent their deployment when passengers are too small. Dual front air bags became standard equipment, but they posed threats to children and small people. Dual inflation levels for air bags are proposed since some bags inflating in low speed crashes have been blamed for killing several people, mostly children.
In 2000 the state of New Jersey authorized police to stop and ticket drivers who are not wearing seat belts. Some states are enacting laws to require seat belt usage and some auto makers are installing audio and visual signals to show when belts are not engaged.
In a 1998 provincial election Bouchard won more seats (but slightly less of the popular vote) and did not get enough votes to permit another referendum immediately. Bouchard and his Parti Quebecois retained control in 1998 provincial elections. The results were much closer with the Separatists continuing control of the Quebec legislature, but losing a single seat and gaining only 42.7% of the vote compared to the Liberal (Federalist) 43.7%. Bouchard's ruling party won re-election in the 1998 election.
The issue was presented to the Supreme Court which ruled in August 1998 that Quebec could not separate unilaterally and if a referendum favored separation details would have to be negotiated with Canada. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court decided against the constitutionality of unilateral secession. The Supreme Court, hearing the case of Quebec separation, ruled that, under the Canadian Constitution and international law, Quebec could not separate unilaterally from Canada and that if separatists won a referendum on independence, the government would be obliged to negotiate with Quebec. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled against unilateral secession, but stipulated that federal officials would be obligated to negotiate if a clear majority of Quebeckers voted for secession in a fair referendum.
However, it did say that if a majority of Quebeckers voted in favor of secession, federal officials would be obliged to negotiate.

Language and cultural differences divide Quebec, Canada's only province with a French-speaking majority, from the rest of the country. It stemmed from the feeling among Quebeckers that their culture is different from the rest of Canada -- more than 80 percent of the 7 million Quebeckers speak French.
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien declared that unilateral secession was illegal and could only be accomplished through a constitutional amendment. Canada's Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, ruled out any declaration of independence even if Quebec voted for secession in another referendum.
Polls indicated most Quebeckers didn't want another referendum. The Separatist movement appeared in shatters and polls showed only 41% favoring independence. Polls also show support for separation had declined, although there was feeling that just the threat of separation is enough to bring about change. However, support for separation was low.
Meanwhile, the federal government introduced a bill aimed at making separation attempts more difficult. In 1999, Chretien proposed legislation making secession attempts difficult for Quebec.
The movement for separation of Quebec from Canada began in the 1960's leading to the first referendum in the province in May 1980 when 40% voted for independence. In the first referendum on independence, in May 1980, separatist gained 40 percent of votes in Quebec. Quebeckers voted on two independence referendums, unsuccessfully in 1980 and nearly victoriously in 1995.
The movement for separation of Quebec from Canada began in the 1960's leading to the first referendum in the province in May 1980 when 40% voted for independence. The political movement for the province of Quebec to attain independence from Canada began in the 1960s. Since the separatist movement began in Quebec in the 1960's, the sentiment for breaking up Canada appeared to gain some momentum in recent years.
A 1995 a referendum on Quebec independence was defeated, but by a much smaller margin than previously. Quebeckers voted on two independence referendums, unsuccessfully in 1980 and nearly victoriously in 1995. Another referendum was held in October 1995, and this time the vote in favor was just over 49 percent. In another referendum in 1995 the "yes" vote was a very strong loser with over 49% of the vote.
Opinion indicated that Quebeckers wanted Bouchard to focus on the economy rather than independence. Quebeckers wanted the government to deal instead with economic conditions.
Repeated U.S. Supreme Court rulings have found that creationism is not science, but a religious belief by some American fundamentalist Christians who literally interpret the Bible to mean the universe, the Earth and its creatures were created in six days by God only 10,000 years ago and that humans descended from Adam and Eve, not other life forms. Proponents of "Creation Science" believe a divine being created humans and other species a mere 10,000 years ago, and generally use the Bible as the ultimate authority on how the world was formed. Creationism holds that a divine being created humans and other species 10,000 years ago.

There are two advocacy perspectives on what to teach in American public school biology classes: evolution and creationism. Although there are gradations of emphasis, two basic perspectives are at the core of the debate over teaching of evolution, creation science or intelligent design in public school science classes.
Although there are gradations of emphasis, two basic perspectives are at the core of the debate over teaching of evolution, creation science or intelligent design in public school science classes. Teaching the origins of life on earth is a controversial and emotional topic. There are two advocacy perspectives on what to teach in American public school biology classes: evolution and creationism.
Scientists, teachers, business leaders and clergy say understanding evolution as the unifying principle of biology is important for college entrance exams, employment, personal health, and citizenship. Scientists, science teachers and their supporters see evolution as one of five unifying concepts linking all scientific disciplines.
Supporters of creationism, creation science, and intelligent design are primarily fundamentalist Christians who have faith in the literal truth of the Bible. Repeated U.S. Supreme Court rulings have found that creationism is not science, but a religious belief by some American fundamentalist Christians who literally interpret the Bible to mean the universe, the Earth and its creatures were created in six days by God only 10,000 years ago and that humans descended from Adam and Eve, not other life forms.
Creationists introduced into classrooms theories as "intelligent design" -- the idea that the universe is so complex that it must have been designed on purpose by an intelligent designer. Intelligent design avoids mention of God saying the complexity of the design of the cosmos requires an intelligent designer. They want evolution to be fairly represented and juxtaposed with other theories of life, including the idea that the design and complexity of the design of the cosmos require an intelligent designer.
Eight-three percent of the pubic favor teaching evolution in public schools. Rep. Tom DeLay put the blame for the tragic Columbine High massacre on teaching children "that they are nothing but glorified apes who are evolutionized out of some primordial soup of mud." In 1999 a poll showed 83% of Americans favoring teaching evolution in the public schools and 68% thinking one can both believe in evolution and that God created humans and guided their development.
Evolution science holds that the Earth is billions of years old, and that all species, including humans, arose over millions of years through genetic mutations and natural selection from a few initial life forms. Proponents of evolutionary theory use a plethora of evidence, including fossils and carbon-dating, to show how life forms mutated and branched out from common ancestors in the billions of years since the world came into existence.
Evolution science holds that the Earth is billions of years old, and that all species, including humans, arose over millions of years through genetic mutations and natural selection from a few initial life forms. According to evolutionists, scientific evidence shows that life began almost 4 million years ago with simple organisms, from which humans and all other forms of life evolved gradually over millions of years.
In December 1994 Russian troops were sent into Chechnya to crush a separatist drive led by Dzhokhar Dudayev. In March 1996 Boris Yeltsin halted the offensive, initiating a partial withdrawal from Chechen areas, but warned that more terrorist attacks would be dealt with severely. He promised free and democratic elections and suggested amnesty for some combatants.
In 1996, accords were signed granting Chechnya de facto independence. At this time Chechnya won de facto independence and could run its own affairs, but was left devastated and lawless.
The Russian response has included all-out attempts to occupy Chechnya in 1994-96 and after August 2, 1999, securing borders with Chechnya, air strikes and artillery attacks. In December 1994 Russian troops were sent into Chechnya to crush a separatist drive led by Dzhokhar Dudayev. In March 1996 Boris Yeltsin halted the offensive, initiating a partial withdrawal from Chechen areas, but warned that more terrorist attacks would be dealt with severely. After fifteen months of fighting against Chechen separatists since December 1994, the Russian government announced its intention to withdraw troop stage-by-stage from Chechnya in an effort to end the conflict. Russia sent troops to the Caucus region in December 1994 in an attempt to crush separatist fighters.
To prevent the spread of violence Russia spent the next year strengthening the border areas but did not send troops into Chechnya itself. Moscow still claimed Chechnya is part of Russia and struggled to keep violence from spreading to the rest of the Caucasus region.

In August 1998, Russia launched a massive anti-terrorist military campaign in Chechnya after separatists invaded the neighboring republic of Dagestan and carried out a series of incursions and explosions claiming the lives of over 300 people in several Russian cities, including Moscow. Russia began its military operations inside Chechnya in late September after Chechen rebels' armed incursions into neighboring Dagestan and a spate of terrorist acts in Russian cities that killed over 300. In August and September of 1999, armed Chechen groups invaded neighboring Dagestan, inflicting heavy casualties on Russian troops.

Russia began its military operations inside Chechnya in late September after Chechen rebels' armed incursions into neighboring Dagestan and a spate of terrorist acts in Russian cities that killed over 300.
Russian air strikes were conducted against economic installations, communications facilities, rebel bases, storage areas, bridges, and roads. They first bombed suspected rebel bases, then economic installations and civilian communications facilities. Sometimes the air strikes, and artillery strikes have been against cities and strategic targets and at other times against Chechen positions including those in mountainous terrain.
By 1999, under Putin, Russian air raids continued escalating along the Chechen border to combat aggression. The Chechens said air strikes had killed 550 civilians and that Russian troop losses totaled 1500 compared to 32 for the Chechens. Chechens blamed Russia for many civilian deaths.
Russia was determined to liberate Chechnya from the terrorists and restore normal life and by the end of 1999 Russian troops occupied over 60% of Chechnya. In November 1999 Russia announced its intent to liberate all of Chechnya by February 2000, but by May 2000 only 2/3 of the country was occupied and weekly losses continued on both sides. By November 2000, the Russians occupied 60% of Chechen territory and drove some 2500 rebels into the mountain areas.

Up to 200,000 people were thought to have fled Chechnya since the Russians began their offensive, and some 3,600 people, mainly civilians, were killed according to Chechen leaders. The turbulence resulted in thousands of Chechens trying to leave the republic, and many human rights issues came under examination . Some 3,600 Chechen civilians were killed and almost 200,000 fled the country.
Guerilla and terrorist attacks continued. The Russians continue to face rebel "hit-and-run" attacks.

The Russians say Chechnya must stay within the Russian Confederation. Russia maintained that Chechnya did not have the right to secede.
After extensive investigation of recovered aircraft parts and both black box data recorders, NTSB investigators found no evidence that mechanical or electrical problems or an explosion caused the crash. However, thorough evaluation of the flight data recorder, cockpit voice recorder, radar data, and wreckage led investigators to determine there was no sign of mechanical failure.
The plane plummeted 15,000 feet, but then climbed 8000 feet before its final fall to the ocean. The plane dropped at near supersonic speed for 9,000 meters, then climbed for 2,400 meters before falling and breaking apart. According to Air Force radar, the plane suddenly entered a drastically steep dive to 16,000 feet, slowed and climbed back to 24,000 feet, then turned again in its fatal plunge. Radar tracks of the flight during its final minutes indicated the plane went into a dive but climbed again before going into an extremely steep dive during which some breaking up of the plane occurred.
Electromagnetic interferences by local military radars could have caused shutdown of computerized autopilot, elevators, and engines, but radar evidence is classified. Egyptian authorities discounted the suicide theory and raised the possibility that the plane's problems were caused by electromagnetic interference from military radars. In September, a computer shutdown caused by electromagnetic interference from military radars was speculated.
One thrust reverser had been previously deactivated because of a problem and there was speculation that a thrust reverser had deployed. Initial speculation centered on a thrust reverser (deactivated in Cairo).
Initial speculation centered on a thrust reverser (deactivated in Cairo). One thrust reverser had been previously deactivated because of a problem and there was speculation that a thrust reverser had deployed. Initial speculation that malfunctioning reverse thrusters caused the crash was disproved.
An on-board computer failure, stopping the transponder and providing erroneous data, was speculated. Electrical power ceased, turning off the transponder and flight data recorder. An in-flight electrical problem could explain why the transponder stopped working, and computer failure could lead to erratic behavior as the pilots tried to regain control. The transponder had also stopped working.
Data from one Black Box showed that both engines had been switched off from the cabin and that the elevators, which raise or lower the plane's nose were in an uneven setting, a move not believed possible for the crew to make. Flight data indicated the tail section elevators moved out of unison.
Egyptian officials dispute these theories, saying the likely cause was an unexplained problem in the plane's elevator control system, a missile, a bomb, or electromagnetic interference. In September, a computer shutdown caused by electromagnetic interference from military radars was speculated. Egyptian authorities discounted the suicide theory and raised the possibility that the plane's problems were caused by electromagnetic interference from military radars.
EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed on October 31, 1999 after departing JFK Airport. Shortly after taking off from John F. Kennedy International Airport for Cairo, EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the Atlantic early Sunday, October 31, 1999, killing all 217 people on board.
Neither pilot nor co-pilot sent a distress message. There was no distress call, and an emergency descent was virtually ruled out. Radio communication between the crew and air traffic controllers was routine and they did not advise of either an emergency or mechanical problem before or during the dive. There were no radio reports of trouble.
The flight recorder was recovered on November 9 and revealed that the autopilot was disconnected, the descent appeared "controlled," the cockpit turned off both engines, and the elevators were out of unison. The tail elevators were in uneven positions, indicating a possible malfunction, but it is not known if this was a cause or byproduct of the crash. Flight data indicated the tail section elevators moved out of unison. Data from one Black Box showed that both engines had been switched off from the cabin and that the elevators, which raise or lower the plane's nose were in an uneven setting, a move not believed possible for the crew to make.

A criminal act involving a hijacking, suicide, or a crew fight was also possible and the background, medical history, and emotional stability of the passengers and crew were examined. Other lingering theories include hijacking, terrorism, crew fight, or a deliberate criminal or suicidal act by the backup copilot.
Investigators found little in recent activities, background, medical history, and emotional stability of crew and passengers. A criminal act involving a hijacking, suicide, or a crew fight was also possible and the background, medical history, and emotional stability of the passengers and crew were examined.
Cockpit voice recordings indicated that someone uttered a prayer in Arabic just before the autopilot disengaged raising questions of a possible terrorist or suicide act. The cockpit voice recorder was recovered on November 15.
After extensive investigation of recovered aircraft parts and both black box data recorders, NTSB investigators found no evidence that mechanical or electrical problems or an explosion caused the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board stated on January 21, 2000 that there was no sign of mechanical failure.

There were no survivors. Shortly after taking off from John F. Kennedy International Airport for Cairo, EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the Atlantic early Sunday, October 31, 1999, killing all 217 people on board.
The prayer he uttered and final comments on the cockpit voice recorder led investigators to suspect his suicide. It contained the co-pilot chanting, "I rely on God" and the pilot ordering actions to control the aircraft. Cockpit voice recordings indicated that someone uttered a prayer in Arabic just before the autopilot disengaged raising questions of a possible terrorist or suicide act. The cockpit voice recorder captured someone uttering a prayer before the autopilot disengaged.

Other lingering theories include hijacking, terrorism, crew fight, or a deliberate criminal or suicidal act by the backup copilot. The plane's copilot had been having problems and had exhibited strange behavior in a New York hotel before the flight suggesting he may have deliberately crashed the plane. The prayer he uttered and final comments on the cockpit voice recorder led investigators to suspect his suicide.

However, since the violent occurrences in Littleton, Colorado and Jonesboro, Arkansas, school officials nationwide are taking precautions to prevent violence in their schools. Violent occurrences and shootings resulting in the deaths of students and teachers in several parts of the country have forced school authorities to implement measures to prevent more tragedy. A series of well-publicized school shooting in Colorado, Mississippi, Kentucky, Arkansas, and Oregon caused schools and school districts to take measures to prevent school violence and shootings.
Some officers are armed and some bring dogs trained to sniff out explosives and the officers sometimes conduct weapons sweeps. These preventive measures included posting armed security officers in schools; using metal detectors and surveillance cameras, conducting searches for weapons in schools; tightening access to campuses and improving screening for school visitors; locking most school entrances during the school day; installing a hot line and tip box for reporting incidents that might lead to violence; expelling students who bring a gun to school; requiring school uniforms; making it harder to conceal a weapon by requiring transparent book bags and forbidding baggy clothing.
Schools keep all but main doors locked, require visitor passes, and some have installed panic alarms. These preventive measures included posting armed security officers in schools; using metal detectors and surveillance cameras, conducting searches for weapons in schools; tightening access to campuses and improving screening for school visitors; locking most school entrances during the school day; installing a hot line and tip box for reporting incidents that might lead to violence; expelling students who bring a gun to school; requiring school uniforms; making it harder to conceal a weapon by requiring transparent book bags and forbidding baggy clothing.
Other preventative measures include anti-bullying programs, mentor programs, increased school psychologists and counselors, identifying and treating troubled students before they become dangerous, and hot lines and tip lines for reporting disturbing student behavior. These preventive measures included posting armed security officers in schools; using metal detectors and surveillance cameras, conducting searches for weapons in schools; tightening access to campuses and improving screening for school visitors; locking most school entrances during the school day; installing a hot line and tip box for reporting incidents that might lead to violence; expelling students who bring a gun to school; requiring school uniforms; making it harder to conceal a weapon by requiring transparent book bags and forbidding baggy clothing. Hot lines and tip boxes have been established to identify students with problems that could lead to violence.
In addition, school administrators are suspending any student who makes threats. Schools post signs warning of suspensions for bringing weapons into schools and students who violate the rules do often receive lengthy suspensions. These preventive measures included posting armed security officers in schools; using metal detectors and surveillance cameras, conducting searches for weapons in schools; tightening access to campuses and improving screening for school visitors; locking most school entrances during the school day; installing a hot line and tip box for reporting incidents that might lead to violence; expelling students who bring a gun to school; requiring school uniforms; making it harder to conceal a weapon by requiring transparent book bags and forbidding baggy clothing.
They are promoting friendship and trying to negate rage. Theses included fostering an environment where violent behavior is not tolerated; teaching students social skills as anger management; introducing conflict-resolution programs; and building partnerships between schools, law enforcement, social services, parents, and the community. Children are being taught to better deal with problems before they grow into rage.
They do lockdown drills, and teachers and staff receive security training. In addition, teachers and principals were trained on responding to armed intruders and on conducting lockdowns -- what teachers and students should do when there is an intruder and the police are on their way.
Some of these measures are modifications or additions to the school's physical plant such as installing metal detectors and surveillance cameras, keeping most doors locked, removing lockers that could be used to store weaponry, removing things that could provide concealment for a sniper. Schools keep all but main doors locked, require visitor passes, and some have installed panic alarms.

Some officers are armed and some bring dogs trained to sniff out explosives and the officers sometimes conduct weapons sweeps. Physical building security measures include removing lockers, on-campus armed guards, metal detectors, gun- and bomb-sniffing dogs, and video surveillance.
Other preventative measures include anti-bullying programs, mentor programs, increased school psychologists and counselors, identifying and treating troubled students before they become dangerous, and hot lines and tip lines for reporting disturbing student behavior. They are instituting programs to bring about conflict resolution and to stop bullying. They are also instituting anti-bullying campaigns.
Schools post signs warning of suspensions for bringing weapons into schools and students who violate the rules do often receive lengthy suspensions. Many districts have gun-free campaigns and encourage reporting of any suspicious student behavior.

Physical building security measures include removing lockers, on-campus armed guards, metal detectors, gun- and bomb-sniffing dogs, and video surveillance. External safety measures include security checks by armed officers assigned to the schools, student identification cards, random locker inspections, metal detectors, panic buttons in the classrooms, video cameras on school buses, and erection of fences, increased lighting, and trimming of shrubbery around the school. Some officers are armed and some bring dogs trained to sniff out explosives and the officers sometimes conduct weapons sweeps.
In 2000, Price Charles launched a scholarship in memory of Lawrence to open up architecture, Lawrence's chosen field of study, to ethnic minorities. In September 2000, the Prince of Wales established the Stephen Lawrence architectural scholarship for minorities. Prince Charles launched a scholarship for minority students interested in architecture in memory of Stephen Lawrence.
Stephen Lawrence, a promising 18 year-old son of Jamaican immigrant parents, was stabbed to death at a London bus stop in April 1993. Stephen's parents, Jamaican immigrants, publicly pursued justice for their son, even bringing two suspects to civil court.
To many, Lawrence became a symbol of racial struggle in Britain, a country that had never had a civil rights movement. Britain overall is 94% white and has never had a civil rights movement.
In 2000, Price Charles launched a scholarship in memory of Lawrence to open up architecture, Lawrence's chosen field of study, to ethnic minorities. In September 2000, the Prince of Wales established the Stephen Lawrence architectural scholarship for minorities.
When none of the suspects were brought to trial, they filed a civil suit against them. In 1996 Stephen's parents, initiated a civil suit, where three were acquitted and the other two were dismissed, which prompted widespread public outrage. Stephen's parents, Jamaican immigrants, publicly pursued justice for their son, even bringing two suspects to civil court.
When three suspects were acquitted in the civil suit, the public was outraged at the incompetence of the investigation and the suspect's attitudes at the inquiry. In 1996 Stephen's parents, initiated a civil suit, where three were acquitted and the other two were dismissed, which prompted widespread public outrage.
A play about Lawrence's killing, "The Color of Justice", played to rave reviews in London. A play about Lawrence's murder, Color of Justice, sold out to rave reviews. A play, The Color of Justice, which dramatized the incident, was extremely popular.
In Feb 1999, a government report found London's police force "riven with pernicious and institutionalized racism". London's Metropolitan Police, according to a later government report were found to be "riven with pernicious and institutionalized racism". Racism in the police department was exposed. A government report into the incident found London's police force to be rife with "pernicious and institutionalized racism".
Stephen's parents filed law suits against the five suspects and the Metropolitan Police over the failed investigation on the sixth anniversary of his killing. They also sued the Metropolitan Police for the incompetent murder investigation.
Since supply in foreign countries exceeds demand in the US, there are concerns about families looking for cheapest or "best quick deal" adoptions. In many foreign countries the supply of babies exceeds the demand. Internationally there are far more orphans than adoptive parents.
Some adopted foreign children, mainly Asiatics, have problems with race issues, or loss of their self-identity. The first children adopted from foreign countries had only their adoptive parents for support and often suffered from discrimination. Most international adoptees look different than their white, middle-class parents and come from very different cultures creating issues of cultural identity and racial bias. U.S. families and their foreign adoptees struggle with race and culture identity, and racial bias.
Many US couples look to international adoptions because of a smaller and smaller supply of white American-born infants and the expense in competing for them. In 1999, 16,396 adopted children came to the US from abroad.
Russia and China, the primary sources for adoption by Americans, have recently passed laws that put tighter restrictions on the procedures for adoption. Most children came from Russia, China, and Korea.
Changes in Chinese law restrict foreigner adoptions by encouraging domestic adoption of multiple children by younger families who are not childless, an exception to China's one child per family rule. Russia and China, the primary sources for adoption by Americans, have recently passed laws that put tighter restrictions on the procedures for adoption.
Russia has replaced China as the nation providing most children for adoption in the US and those two countries have been amending their laws to prevent abuses in adoptions. Russia exports more adopted children, mostly to the U.S., than any other country, and is the world's largest supplier of Caucasian adoptees.
The Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoptions establishes safeguards so that international adoptions meet global standards to protect children. In July 2000, the US ratified the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, which was created to establish guidelines for international adoptions, harmonize the practices of different countries, improve the treatment of children, and curtail corruption, fraud and smuggling in the process.
Russia and China, the primary sources for adoption by Americans, have recently passed laws that put tighter restrictions on the procedures for adoption. Russia tightened control over foreigner adoptions by encouraging domestic adoptions and banning intermediaries, such as the Russian Mafia.
It is estimated that from three to five or even nine percent of children have the disorder, which twenty percent may outgrow. ADHD, a common psychiatric illness that affects 3-9% of all children, is difficult to diagnose because there is no easy test like a blood test. The American Psychiatric Association first described it in 1980, and some four to twelve percent of American children are now thought to have the disorder.
Outward symptoms generally include impulsiveness, inability to concentrate, difficulty in learning, and restlessness. ADHD, a chemical disorder in the brain, can cause impulsivity, inability to concentrate, and difficulty learning.
Girls have Type A, characterized by inattentiveness and distractibility; boys have type B and are hyperactive and impulsive. Type A is characterized by inattentiveness and distractability, Type B by hyperactivity and impulsive behavior, and Type C a combination of the two.
Brain scans show a chemical abnormality. ADD/ADHD is diagnosed through behavioral patterns but many of those afflicted have been found to have a high concentration of a key brain protein, a dopamine transporter, which could lead to a clinical diagnosis. ADHD, a chemical disorder in the brain, can cause impulsivity, inability to concentrate, and difficulty learning.
Behavior-modification therapy is the primary treatment in Britain but in the U.S. drugs have been found more effective. Medication so far appears to be more effective than behavior modification therapy when treating ADHD alone.
Stimulant-based medications; namely, Ritalin (methylphenidate), have recently been shown to be the most effective way of treating ADHD. One treatment is methylphenidate (tradename Ritalin), a mild nervous system stimulant which may boost levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter, in the brain.
Some critics think the drugs are over-prescribed and suppress a child's natural spontaneity rather than correcting a brain chemistry imbalance. Many parents and experts, however, believe that doctors are throwing medication at children as a quick way of quieting them without trying less invasive methods such as behavior modification therapy. However, problems still exist: undesirable side effects, abusive use and theft of Ritalin for psychic effects, over diagnosing and over prescribing, and accusations of parental neglect by failing to give the prescribed medication to their children. Critics say that doctors are too quick to diagnose ADHD and over-prescribe drugs for children.
Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) are neurological and genetic disorders that are evident in childhood and continue through adulthood. Attention Deficit Disorder, ADHD, has become increasingly common in American children with some 2.5 million diagnosed. ADHD, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, is a neurological and genetic disorder characterized by impulsivity, inattentiveness, and lack of inhibition and self-control.
One treatment is methylphenidate (tradename Ritalin), a mild nervous system stimulant which may boost levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter, in the brain. Taken in three-a-day doses, it quiets hyperactivity by boosting seretonin, a neurotransmitter that restores proper balance with other natural brain chemicals.
Controversies surrounding ADD/ADHD treatment are that no one knows the long-range effects of the drugs. There has been much controversy around diagnosis and treatment of ADHD. Use of those drugs to treat ADD/ADHD is highly controversial.

To stay competitive, traditional booksellers increased personal service, sponsored special events, and began selling online and offering broad search capabilities. To face competition from online marketing, the ABA has created its own online store for independent booksellers, Book Sense.
It censured author Frank McCourt for participating in chainstore advertising, challenged barnesandnoble.com's claim "If we don't have your book nobody does," led successful opposition to B&N's plan to purchase the largest book distributor (threatening independents with reduced service and compromised records), and joined the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association in urging collection of taxes from on-line bookstores. California sellers urged that state to collect taxes on major online retailers such as Amazon.
The first is Booksense.com, a "hub site" for hundreds of individual sites created and maintained by local stores. The Independents also established its own national online store, Book Sense, to stave off fierce competition from Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com. To meet online competition, the ABA opened Book Sense and Contentville, online selling and commentary sites serving as hubs for individual stores. To face competition from online marketing, the ABA has created its own online store for independent booksellers, Book Sense.
To meet online competition, the ABA opened Book Sense and Contentville, online selling and commentary sites serving as hubs for individual stores. The second will be Contentville, in which about 40 of the most respected booksellers will provide editorial comment.
The chains and independents have also established online sites. Many small booksellers developed websites to have an online presence for advertising and selling their books. To stay competitive, traditional booksellers increased personal service, sponsored special events, and began selling online and offering broad search capabilities.
Independent booksellers have had great difficulty competing against the major chain stores, Barnes & Noble and Borders Books and online giant, Amazon. Big chains are proliferating and squeezing out independent bookstores. Independent bookstores have been seriously damaged by superstore chains and also have been set back by increasing online sales.
In the 1990s, membership in the American Bookseller Association, which represents the independent stores, dropped by almost half, as bookstores were forced to close their doors. Their portion of the book market was cut in half during this decade and membership in their trade organization, the American Booksellers Association (ABA) dropped from 5,200 to 3,500. The American Booksellers Association (ABA) that represents the independents saw its membership drop from 5,200 to less than 3,500.
Their portion of the book market was cut in half during this decade and membership in their trade organization, the American Booksellers Association (ABA) dropped from 5,200 to 3,500. In 1991, the independents claimed nearly a third of adult book purchases but six years later their market share was nearly cut in half, down to 17%. Independents lost half their market share in six years and many have closed.
They began an opposition campaign with appeals to the FTC, accusing Barnes & Noble of unfair trade practices. Independent booksellers, after a two-decade war against chains and online booksellers, are seeking to gain ground in a number of ways, including appeals to the FTC.
In 1991, the independents claimed nearly a third of adult book purchases but six years later their market share was nearly cut in half, down to 17%. By 1999, independent booksellers held only a 17 percent market share.
Most books are now sold in nontraditional outlets, including discount stores and the internet. Independent booksellers have had great difficulty competing against the major chain stores, Barnes & Noble and Borders Books and online giant, Amazon. Independent bookstores have been seriously damaged by superstore chains and also have been set back by increasing online sales.
Online bookselling continued to increase its share of the book market. Online book sales captured 2% of the market in 1999 and were projected to rise to 10% by 2002 and 18% by 2003. Independent bookstores have been seriously damaged by superstore chains and also have been set back by increasing online sales.
The Independents also established its own national online store, Book Sense, to stave off fierce competition from Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com. To meet online competition, the ABA opened Book Sense and Contentville, online selling and commentary sites serving as hubs for individual stores. To face competition from online marketing, the ABA has created its own online store for independent booksellers, Book Sense.
The plane struck a hotel near Paris, killing all 109 aboard and four on the ground. All 109 aboard the aircraft, most of whom were German tourists, and four persons at the crash site died. The only supersonic passenger plane--the Concorde--crashed on July 25, 2000, killing all 109 on board and 4 on the ground. German tourists comprised most of the 109 passengers on board when the Concorde slammed into a small hotel, only two miles from the airport killing all aboard and four people on the ground.
At $11,000 per ticket, primarily wealthy businessmen and celebrities were passengers. The cost is $10,000 for a round trip. A roundtrip flight cost $10,000.
The plane had 100 seats and flew 1,300 mph at 60,000 feet. The Concorde flew at 1300 miles an hour, making the transatlantic flight in three and a half hours. The needle-nosed aircraft flies at 60,000 feet and 1,350 mph completing its journey from London to New York in about 3 hours, 30 minutes.

The fleet of 13 supersonic planes flew regularly from London and Paris to New York until July 25, 2000, the date of a tragic crash near Paris. Twenty planes were built and 13 were still flying in 2000. British airways and Air France, the only companies operating Concordes, own ten and six, respectively.
Air France paid $20,000 each to surviving families to cover immediate expenses. Air France paid each family $20,000 to cover immediate expenses.
1,500 mourners gathered in Cologne for memorial services. Memorial services were held in Paris, in Cologne, Germany, and later at the crash site.
An investigation revealed the cause was a piece of metal on the runway that gashed a tire. Investigators in France determined the probable cause of the crash was a 16-inch piece of metal on the runway that caused a tire to blow out, sending debris from the tire through the fuel tanks, triggering a fire that shut down two engines. The French opened an inquiry to place blame, hearing from 295 witnesses.
A nine person crew provided luxury service and gourmet food and drink. There is an unending stream of gourmet food and drink as well as rapid check-in and immigration processing.
The Concorde could make the flight between New York and London or Paris in less than four hours and once set a record by doing it in slightly less than three. The fleet of 13 supersonic planes flew regularly from London and Paris to New York until July 25, 2000, the date of a tragic crash near Paris. It took less that 4 hours to cross the Atlantic carrying the rich, the famous, and business people. The supersonic passenger jet, Concorde, has been flying trans-Atlantic and charter routes for almost 25 years.
All bodies and debris were removed from the crash site and all victims were identified. All the bodies were found and identified and the wreckage was moved to be reassembled.
British airways and Air France, the only companies operating Concordes, own ten and six, respectively. Just twenty of the transports were built and only British Airways and Air France flew them.
The boat, one of Russia's largest, was commissioned in 1996 and carried a crew of 118. The 14,000-ton submarine settled 354 to 450 feet down, trapping 118 sailors. On August 12, 2000 the 118-man Russian submarine Kursk sank to 350 feet in the Barents Sea during naval exercises. On August 19, 2000, a Russian nuclear submarine with 118 men aboard sank to the bottom of the Barents Sea while on a training mission.
Nuclear reactors powering the ship were taken off line and no radiation leaks detected. Its nuclear reactor was shut down and attempts to hook air lines failed, so oxygen would last only a few days. The ship was reported not to be carrying nuclear weapons and its nuclear reactor had been switched off.
Russia rejected a French offer. Russia turned down a French offer of help and Germany's offer of medical specialists.
These rescue teams arrived at the scene on August 19 and began the descent to the Kursk on the 20th. Rescue vehicles arrived Saturday.
The Russians began a massive rescue effort on August 13 and announced the loss the next day, when 15 vessels and warships were involved in the search. The first official announcements were made on Aug 14.
Russian efforts to reach the submarine using underwater capsules failed and Russia talked to NATO officials. Russian navy rescue efforts were complicated by strong underwater currents and near zero visibility at the 450 feet depth where the vessel was trapped and by heavy surface storms.
Russian officials speculated that the Kursk collided with another vessel, probably a foreign submarine, or encountered a World War II mine. Russians say the explosion was caused by collision with a non-Russian vessel or a not uncommonly encountered WWII-era mine.
After initially refusing Western aid, the Russians agreed to accept rescue submarines and divers from Britain and Norway. Initially, top officials refused foreign assistance.
On Aug 21, a British mini-submarine could not dock with the terribly damaged escape hatch. A British mini-submarine was unable to dock with an escape hatch.
Russians say the explosion was caused by collision with a non-Russian vessel or a not uncommonly encountered WWII-era mine. Russian officials speculated that the Kursk collided with another vessel, probably a foreign submarine, or encountered a World War II mine. The Russians, who ultimately signed a contract with Dutch and Belgian companies to retrieve the submarine, continued to insist throughout that the sinking was caused by a collision.
In September Russia began separate operations, first to retrieve the crewmen's bodies, by public demand, by cutting holes throughout the hull, and then to raise the entire wreck, which had no nuclear missiles onboard. Sailors' bodies were to be retrieved in October or November by cutting holes in the hull.
The condition of the crew could not be determined and efforts to hook air and fuel lines failed. Repeated efforts to hook up air and fuel lines and dock with the escape hatch were frustrated by bad sea conditions.
By the seventh day, repeated attempts to dock with an escape hatch failed and Russian officials were virtually certain that all the crew were dead. On Aug 21, a British mini-submarine could not dock with the terribly damaged escape hatch. Repeated efforts to hook up air and fuel lines and dock with the escape hatch were frustrated by bad sea conditions.
On Saturday, August 12, 2000, Russia's nuclear submarine Kursk fell to the bottom of the Barents Sea while on a training mission in international waters near the Arctic Circle. On August 19, 2000, a Russian nuclear submarine with 118 men aboard sank to the bottom of the Barents Sea while on a training mission. The Russian Oscar II-class, atomic powered submarine, the Kursk, sank in the Barents Sea on August 12, 2000 during a naval exercise.
On Tuesday it approached NATO about help and by Wednesday accepted British and Norwegian offers. On August 16, Russia asked Britain and Norway to send a rescue submarine and divers.
The United States believed one of the Kursk's torpedoes misfired causing a massive explosion. Russians say the explosion was caused by collision with a non-Russian vessel or a not uncommonly encountered WWII-era mine. Initial reports indicated that the ship may have been involved in a collision or could have been damaged by an explosion. Possible causes of the accident were a collision (favored Russian explanation, perhaps as the Kursk rose to periscope level), an onboard explosion (most likely explanation, probably involving a torpedo and triggering further detonations), or hitting a WWII mine.
El Nino is a periodic weather phenomenon caused by abnormal warming of the water in the eastern Pacific. El Nino is a disruptive weather phenomenon that usually occurs every three to four years on the average. It usually occurs around December every 3-6 years.
Trade winds may reverse direction. It can disrupt climate around the world, producing extra rain in the southeastern U.S., Peru and Ecuador during the winter, while causing drought in the western Pacific as well as the slowing of trade winds and changes in sea levels.
It may also help cut global warming by temporarily stemming release of carbon dioxide from the Pacific Ocean. El Nino may lessen global warming by temporarily stemming the release of carbon dioxide from the Pacific.
It may also help cut global warming by temporarily stemming release of carbon dioxide from the Pacific Ocean. El Nino may lessen global warming by temporarily stemming the release of carbon dioxide from the Pacific. This warming changes the winds and atmospheric pressure, shifting weather patterns and reducing carbon dioxide release.
La Nina is the phenomenon of rapidly cooling equatorial waters in the central Pacific. There is abnormal cooling of the Pacific sea surface creating a colder, stronger jet stream in the upper atmosphere. La Nina alternates with El Nino and is fueled by abnormally cold water in the eastern Pacific.
El Nino and El Nina are opposite extremes of continuous but far ranging changes in water surface temperature, precipitation, trade winds, and sea level in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, which portend extreme changes and reversals in usual global climate and weather patterns, resulting in dangerous temperature changes, storms, floods and droughts world wide, with severe economic impacts, disease and death. It develops every several years and works in reverse of El Nino. La Nina reverses El Nino's effects but also brings drought to some parts of the planet while drenching others.
Scientists in the United States, Australia, Israel, and Germany are using sophisticated computer simulations. Computer module studies and satellite systems allow for a better understanding of how El Nino and La Nina form but, unfortunately, when they will develop or what they hold for the future still cannot be predicted. Predicting El Nino and its behavior is aided by computer modeling, a detection system that monitors Pacific winds and waves through 70 stations floating on buoys, and weather satellites that detect ocean warming. Scientific technologies and techniques for studying these phenomena include: computer modeling, simulation and forecasting of global climate and weather; onsite and remote satellite measurement of changes in weather data, deep ocean waves, sea level, surface temperature, greenhouse gas concentrations, clouds, rain, severe storms, sun spot activity, and sediment layers; and weather-correlated epidemiological studies.

Low-income Americans face problems in finding housing because their numbers have increased over the last two decades while the pool of affordable housing has shrunk. In 1995 there were 4.4 million more low-income earners than there were low-cost housing units and the pool of affordable housing was shrinking.
Landlords have dropped out of subsidy programs or properties have been closed because of age or razed. Landlords were dropping out of rent subsidy programs to raise the rent or convert the real estate to condominiums.
In addition, rents were going up faster than incomes. Wages haven't kept up with housing cost rises driven by a strong economy. Part of the problem is wage increases have failed to keep up with steep increases in rental rates.
Congress refused any new assistance vouchers between 1995-1998. No new U.S. federal housing assistance vouchers were created after 1994.
Using these vouchers to buy a home became possible in 2000. Vouchers could be used to pay home mortgages. Real or proposed measures include block grants to states for housing assistance, greater availability of rent subsidies and federally insured mortgages, use of rent vouchers to help buy a home, and incentives or requirements to keep landlords in subsidy programs and encourage the creation of subsidized housing units.
To make matters worse, many owners of rental units now rent to higher income tenants or sell their properties as condos. Landlords were dropping out of rent subsidy programs to raise the rent or convert the real estate to condominiums.
In 1997 at least 4.5 million families were paying more than 50% of their income on housing, up 12% since 1991. In 1997 5.4 million were paying more than 50% of income for housing.
Fidel Castro and Elian's father Juan Miguel Gonzalez demanded Elian's return to Cuba. Elian's great-uncle in Florida was granted temporary custody, but his father demanded his return to Cuba. Cuban-Americans in Miami protested vehemently and often for the boy to remain in the U.S. In Cuba, Elian's father demanded his return, and thousands of Cubans rallied to demand it.
On June 1 the appeal was denied and this denial was upheld on June 23. The U.S. appeals court reaffirmed its decision to return Elian to his father. The 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled for the government and Elian's father, later reaffirming its decision. On June 1, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta ruled for the government and Elian's father.
His Miami relatives refused to meet with his father in Washington, and Attorney General Reno met with Gonzales relatives in an effort to end the stalemate. Reno met with the relatives and ordered them to surrender Elian.
Elian's Cuban grandmothers visited him in Florida in January and, in April, his father arrived in Washington. The drama intensified when the boy's father traveled to the U.S. on April 6.
He filed a federal lawsuit, which was dismissed in March, but Elian was enjoined from leaving the United States during the appeal process. On March 21, a U.S. District Judge dismissed Lazaro Gonzales' lawsuit. The relatives challenged the INS ruling, then appealed their suit's dismissal. Numerous court appeals by his Miami relatives to overturn the decision were denied.
On April 17, The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry demanded the U.S. end its Cuba embargo and honor the 1995 Immigration Agreement by returning to Cuba all illegal Cuban deportees. Vietnam demanded Elian be returned to Cuba.
He, his mother, and 12 others had fled Cuba in a motorboat that capsized. His mother drowned when their boat capsized in her failed attempt to bring the child to freedom. On November 22, 1999, 6-year old Elian Gonzales escaped Cuba by boat with his mother. On November 25, 1999, six-year-old Elian Gonzalez was rescued from the Atlantic after the boat in which he and his mother and others were fleeing Cuba for the US capsized and his mother drowned.
On January 12, Reno upheld Elian's father's right to custody, telling the Florida courts they have no say in this federal matter. Reno upheld the father's right to custody and ignored Florida court interference, stating immigration was a federal matter.
On November 25, 1999, six-year-old Elian Gonzalez was rescued from the Atlantic after the boat in which he and his mother and others were fleeing Cuba for the US capsized and his mother drowned. Elian Gonzales, 6, was rescued at sea on November 25, 1999. On November 25, Elian was rescued at sea. On November 25, 2000, six-year-old Elian Gonzales was rescued at sea, found lashed to an inner tube, floating off the coast of Miami.
His great-uncle in Miami was granted temporary custody of Elian and sought asylum for him. Elian's Miami relatives were given temporary custody. On November 26, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service granted great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez temporary custody of Elian in Miami. Elian's great-uncle in Florida was granted temporary custody, but his father demanded his return to Cuba.
The Supreme Court rejected an appeal by the Miami relatives. After a final appeal by the Miami relatives was denied and the court order blocking his return expired, Elian returned with his father to Cuba on June 28, 2000. On June 28, the Supreme Court rejected a final appeal; Elian returned home to Cuba, was celebrated in the media and returned to his home and schooling. On June 28 the Supreme Court refused to review the case or extend the injunction.
Former President Jimmy Carter has played an active role on the international stage. In the years since he left office, he has traveled extensively to monitor elections, conduct peace negotiations, and establish relief efforts.
The Center's delegations have observed elections in China (where Carter fosters his one-China policy), Indonesia, Nigeria, Liberia, and Mozambique. By 1999 he had monitored more than 20 elections in 16 countries including Nicaragua, Liberia, Nigeria, Venezuela, China (village and township committee elections), Indonesia, Mozambique, Peru, the Dominican Republic and Mexico. Carter Center observer missions, often including former heads of state, have monitored at least 20 elections in 16 countries, including China, the Dominican Republic, Guyana, Indonesia, Liberia, Mexico, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela.

In addition, he and his wife, Rosalynn, established the Carter Center in 1982. Working in conjunction with the Carter Center that he founded and the National Democratic Institute of International Affairs, Carter has led many international teams of observers to monitor elections throughout the world. In 1982, Carter established the Carter Center, a human rights organization based in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1982, former US president Jimmy Carter and his wife founded the Carter Center, devoted to observing countries and furthering their democracy and development, human rights issues, and public health.
He produced a cease-fire in Bosnia, stopped a U.S. invasion of Haiti, and may have averted a war in North Korea. Carter's involvement helped persuade Ortega to accept Nicaraguan election results that deposed him, persuade Cedras to leave Haiti and avoid a US invasion, win freedom for thousands of political prisoners, and possibly avert war in Korea.

His efforts to find peaceful solutions to conflicts led him to negotiate with leaders as Yasser Arafat, Kim IL-sung, Daniel Ortega, Raoul Cedras, and Radovan Karadic. He is credited with gaining release of approximately 50,000 political prisoners, not hesitating to meet personally with such leaders as Yasser Arafat, Kim-Il-Sung, Daniel Ortega, Haitian bully Raoal Cedras and Bosnian Serb Radovan Karadzic. He has met with various dictators, including Yasser Arafat, Kim Il-sung, and Daniel Ortega, to plead the case for peace and obtain the release of some 50,000 political prisoners.
They also provided funds to fight river blindness, a disease that infects 18 million people mainly in Africa. This disease is caused by black flies and 18 million people were infected by 1999.
Carter and the Carter Center contributed to the near global eradication of Guinea worm disease, a disease infesting more than 3 million people annually in tropical Africa, India, and Pakistan. In 1986 an estimated 3 million people were infested each year with this roundworm.

It was founded to battle racial bias and has expanded its efforts by tracking hate crimes and the increasing spread of racist organizations across the US. It tracks US hate crimes and the spread of racist organizations. The SPLC participates in tracking down hate groups and publicizing their activities in its Intelligence Report, teaching tolerance and bringing lawsuits against discriminatory practices and hate groups.
In 1991 it started a classroom program "Teaching Tolerance" which features books, videos, posters and a magazine that goes to more than 400,000 teachers. A core initiative for the center is a classroom program started in 1991 called "Teaching Tolerance," that involves more than 400,000 teachers and includes materials promoting "interracial and intercultural understanding". Through its Teaching Tolerance program it provides materials to teachers to promote interracial and intercultural understanding. "Teaching Tolerance" is a major program of the Center.
Dees and the SPLC have fought to break the organizations by legal action resulting in severe financial penalties. As a white lawyer, Dees has been instrumental in crusading against racial intolerance by using lawsuits to destroy the finances of hate groups. He has used the civil lawsuit like a "Buck Knife, carving financial assets out of hate group leaders". Dees and the SPLC seek to destroy hate groups through multi-million dollar civil suits that go after assets of groups and their leaders.
It charges its clients nothing. It also funded a civil rights litigation program in Georgia to provide free legal assistance to poor people. The SPLC also funds a three-year, $100,000 civil rights litigation program in Georgia designed to stem federal cutbacks in programs that provide free legal assistance to poor people in civil actions. However, Dees does not charge the groups and the Center estimates that it collects only 2% on successful judgments.
It covers right-wing extremists in its magazine Intelligence Report. Other publications of the Center include the magazine "Intelligence Report" and pamphlets "Ten Ways to Fight Hate" and "Fighting Hate at School". The SPLC participates in tracking down hate groups and publicizing their activities in its Intelligence Report, teaching tolerance and bringing lawsuits against discriminatory practices and hate groups. Additionally, the center produces the Intelligence Report, a magazine that tracks hate groups and covers right-wing extremists.
The SPLC devotes much effort to raising the funds needed to help minorities litigate against civil rights abuses. The Center operates mostly on contributions that in the late 1990s have increased to around $100 Million annually.
Morris Dees is a co-founder and leader of the Southern Poverty Law Center, located in Montgomery, Alabama. Morris Dees was co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) in 1971 and has served as its Chief Trial Counsel and Executive Director. The law center's co-founder and chief trial counsel, Morris Dees, has successfully handled civil rights cases for more than 30 years--in 1973 his federal lawsuit had the practical effect of forcing funeral homes to provide equal services to blacks and whites. Morris Dees co-founded the SPLC in 1971 and is its chief trial counsel and executive director, following Julian Bond.
By April 1996 a consultative group was in place to design the new currency and a year later a new currency code was issued to facilitate technical preparations. Euro design development began in 1996. Design of the euro note began in 1996.
By the end of the year Germany was still experimenting with euro coins but France was in full production followed by Finland, Belgium and Spain. In 1998 the test printing of banknotes began and Germany minted some euro coins. Germany was preparing to do so.
By the end of the year Germany was still experimenting with euro coins but France was in full production followed by Finland, Belgium and Spain. France, Finland, Belgium and Spain had begun production of euros. France, Finland, Belgium and Spain have started production of Euro's.

Initial transactions will be cashless. The euro was to be used in cashless trading as of January 1, 1999, but the actual currency was not to go into use until January 1, 2002, with present currencies' ceasing to be legal tender six months later. Despite media skepticism, the European Commission maintained it would be introduced on schedule January 1, 1999, initially for cashless trading.
Bank notes and coins will become legal tender January 1st 2002 while national currencies will stop circulating by July 1st 2002. Euros would become legal tender on January 1, 2002.

By April 1996 a consultative group was in place to design the new currency and a year later a new currency code was issued to facilitate technical preparations. "EUR" will be the currency code. In 1997, the code EUR was ascribed to the euro; Zambia expected to benefit from the currency; and Germany's Bundesbank claimed investors would benefit.
Signs of the euro's acceptance included: two international banks quoting prices in the euro; China welcoming its initiation; Eurostat offering euro-related information online; Bulgaria moving to link its currency with the euro; and Thailand considering using it in foreign reserves. The announcement by two banks in May 1998 that they would quote prices in euro seven months before its official adoption demonstrated the acceptance of the euro by financial markets.
In 1997, the code EUR was ascribed to the euro; Zambia expected to benefit from the currency; and Germany's Bundesbank claimed investors would benefit. In Germany the Bundesbank predicted that private investors would profit.
Examples of AI charges include the following: Israel has been accused of using torture in interrogating Palestinians; Nigeria, of contempt for human rights; Germany, of police racism; Russia, of continuing human rights violations including torture of prisoners and use of the death penalty; Brazil, of holding an unfair trial for an activist; Kosovo, of war crimes; Sri Lanka, of illegal detention camps; Indonesia, of torturing pro-democracy activists; Britain, of selling arms to countries such as Indonesia and Algeria; the U.S., of having the death penalty; and South Korea, of trying to control an independent human rights commission. Examples of Amnesty International initiatives over the past 10 years include: involvement in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict in an attempt to ensure that human rights guarantees be mutually respected; focus on perceived human rights abuses in warring African countries; bringing charges of racism and brutality to bear on police in Europe; bringing attention to persistent human rights violations in Russia; advocating for an impartial retrial for a leader of the Landless Rural Workers Movement in Brazil. Specific criticisms AI has lodged are that German police are racist; that a leader of Brazil's landless movement did not receive a fair trial; and that the international community allowed Cambodia's political killings and intimidation through its "near silence". AI charges of racist acts by the German police were thoroughly investigated by German state officials in what they termed an impartial review that found that the police were not racist as a whole.

Palestine would remove destroying Israel from their Charter. In October they signed a "Wye Plantation" agreement.
The Sharm El Sheikh agreement would mediate final-status agreements by September 1999 on Jerusalem, Palestinian borders, Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, water, and complete Israeli redeployment from West Bank except military zones and Jewish settlements. In attempts to salvage the principles of the Oslo accords, new agreements were signed in 1998 by Netanyahu and Arafat at the Wye Plantaion outside Washington, D.C. and in September 1999 at Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt outlining a framework for a final-status peace accord by September 2000.
Modification of the Oslo accords was followed by some progress in the Wye Plantation peace agreement in October 1998, but by June 2000 as the Palestinians and Israelis embarked on final status talks, Israel had handed over control of only 40% of the West Bank. As of late 2000, the Oslo terms were far from implemented with about 40 percent of the West Bank returned to full or partial Palestinian control.
The Accords were based on the principle of land to the Palestinians in exchange for peace for the Israelis. The 1993 Oslo Accords established the principles of "land for peace" and "security and reciprocity" leading to Palestinian self-rule by May 4, 1999. The 1993 "Oslo Accords," signed by Israeli president Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, were based on the principles of "Land for Peace" and "Palestinian self-rule".
The Sharm El Sheikh agreement would mediate final-status agreements by September 1999 on Jerusalem, Palestinian borders, Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, water, and complete Israeli redeployment from West Bank except military zones and Jewish settlements. Final status talks would include: the status of Jerusalem; the border of the Palestinian entity; the fate of Palestinian refugees; the future of Jewish settlements in the West Bank; the Gaza Strip; and water. The final-status issues yet to be decided include the status of Jerusalem, borders of the Palestinian entity, fate of Palestinian refugees, the future of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and water.

A third and final withdrawal from all of the West Bank would take place before a final peace agreement set for May 4, 1999. Israel was to redeploy its forces in the West Bank in three phases, turning over most of the territory to the Palestinians by May 4th 1999 in exchange for security guarantees.
The Oslo Accord of 1993 stipulated that the Israeli Army would pull back from 80% of Hebron in the West Bank by March 28, 1996. Under the accords, Israel should have completed its pullout from the West Bank town of Hebron in March 1996, but a series of suicide bombing attacks in February delayed the pullout. Israel would redeploy from 80 percent of Hebron by March 1996; from rural West Bank by September 1997, leaving full control to the Palestinian National Authority, opening safe passages between West Bank and Gaza, and lifting closure on Palestinian areas, if Palestinians would abrogate their Charter's article to destroy Israel.
A second phase of Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank was to be completed by September 1997. Israel would redeploy from 80 percent of Hebron by March 1996; from rural West Bank by September 1997, leaving full control to the Palestinian National Authority, opening safe passages between West Bank and Gaza, and lifting closure on Palestinian areas, if Palestinians would abrogate their Charter's article to destroy Israel.
Two factors impeding implementation were the ascent to power in 1996 of the conservative Likud government led by Benjamin Netanyahu and a series of deadly suicide bombings sponsored by Hamas the same year. Under the accords, Israel should have completed its pullout from the West Bank town of Hebron in March 1996, but a series of suicide bombing attacks in February delayed the pullout. The first Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank was delayed after a series of suicide bombing attacks, and again pending the Israeli elections.
The government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in 1996. Two factors impeding implementation were the ascent to power in 1996 of the conservative Likud government led by Benjamin Netanyahu and a series of deadly suicide bombings sponsored by Hamas the same year.
Israel delayed redeployments past its general elections in May 1996. The first Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank was delayed after a series of suicide bombing attacks, and again pending the Israeli elections.
Israel began building more settlements in the occupied territories, delayed troop redeployments in the West Bank, and tightened control over Jerusalem, These policies, together with Hamas terrorist attacks, derailed the peace process and stalemated peace talks. By 1997 Israel's new settlements, land confiscation, delayed redeployments and Palestinian attacks halted implementation.
By 1997 Israel's new settlements, land confiscation, delayed redeployments and Palestinian attacks halted implementation. Israel began building more settlements in the occupied territories, delayed troop redeployments in the West Bank, and tightened control over Jerusalem, These policies, together with Hamas terrorist attacks, derailed the peace process and stalemated peace talks. Israel abandoned the Labor Party's freeze on new settlements and delayed redeployment of its forces in the West Bank, saying the Palestinians were not doing enough to combat terrorism and that more Israelis had died since the Oslo accords than in the 15 years before. After the ascent of Netanyahu as Israeli Prime Minister, progress stalled in the face of vigorous Israeli settlement in the West Bank in defiance of the Oslo accords.

The trial judge disallowed their use of the "gay panic" defense, which theorizes that a person with latent homosexual tendencies would react violently if propositioned by a gay. In November 1999 McKinney was barred from using a "gay panic" defense, which begs "temporary insanity" or "diminished capacity" not within Wyoming law. The presiding judge, Barton Voight, barred McKinney's attorneys from using a "gay panic" defense.
The killing galvanized gays and lesbians nationwide. The extreme brutality of the crime aroused the gay community and candlelight vigils and demonstrations were held at several locations across the nation.

In attempting to get his client a life sentence rather than the death penalty, Tangeman argued that McKinney's past, which included sexual abuse as a child, caused him to lash out in rage at Shepard's sexual advances. At trial in October, McKinney's attorney pleaded that McKinney committed manslaughter because of "gay panic" to homosexual advances from Shepard, because McKinney had been abused homosexually at age 7 and had consensual homosexual sex at 15.
"Obesity is the No. 1 malnutrition problem in the US". Obesity, the number one malnutrition problem in the US, is nearing epidemic proportions. Obesity is a major health problem in the United States. Obesity in the U.S., the fattest nation on earth, is an epidemic costing the healthcare system 50 billion dollars and causing 300,000 deaths annually.
By 1999 more than half of US "citizens" were chronically overweight (body mass index 25) and 22% were obese (BMI 30 or more), up from 12.5% in 1991. Over half of Americans are overweight.
Although US fat intake dropped the past 20 years from 40% to 33% of calories consumed, average daily calorie intake rose from 1,854 to 2.002, translating to 15 pounds gained per year. American daily calorie consumption increased about ten percent from 1980 to 2000.
The causes for obesity may be a combination of genes and environment. Genetic abnormalities don't explain wide-spread obesity, but do offer insights into genetic, drug and diet interventions for obesity cases incurable by diet. While genetic factors influence appetite and the weight-gaining effect of a given quantity of food, the basic causes of the problem are over- consumption of high-calorie food and lack of adequate exercise. Geneticists have found that heredity also plays a role and there is evidence that obesity is linked to hormonal irregularities.
At the current rate, everyone in America will be obese by 2030. If this trend continues all Americans will be obese by 2030. The entire US population could be overweight in a few generations.
One third of American adults are obese. Studies found 20-33% of adults and 15% of children obese and one study placed the figure for Americans as a whole at 17.9%. In 1998 studies found 1 in 3 or 4 Americans obese.
In 1991 only 4 states had a rating greater than 15% while in 1999 45 states reached that level. Forty-five states have obesity rates over 15%. In 1999 45 US states had 15 percent or higher percent obesity rates compared to four states in 1991.
Approximately 300,000 deaths a year are attributed to this obesity epidemic. Obesity in the U.S., the fattest nation on earth, is an epidemic costing the healthcare system 50 billion dollars and causing 300,000 deaths annually.
58% of African-Americans were in the group with 54% of Latinos and 44% of whites. A 1999 survey in Los Angeles county found that 55% of men and 39% of women are overweight; African-Americans have the highest rate of obesity at 58%, Latinos 44%, whites 44% and Asian-Americans the lowest, 25%. Obesity increased faster among 18-29 year olds, college educated people, Hispanics, and African Americans than the general population.
Specific examples of this mix are over-promotion and over-consumption of huge servings of fast food, lack of sidewalks and exercise facilities ad too much television. Populations gain weight as they abandon traditional lower-calorie diets for prosperous modern diets with more calories.
In a separate filing, Gingrich claims that Mrs. Gingrich held all their personal liquid assets and accused her of depleting "a substantial portion" of those assets. The divorce proceedings started on a contentious note with Gingrich claiming that his wife, who managed the couple's finances, had failed to transfer some of his earnings to their joint account.
Marianne sought to depose Callista in order to confirm the nature of her affair with Gingrich and continued to press for the deposition even after the adulterous pair had conceded their long-standing affair. She sought to depose Callista Bisek, Newt's alleged mistress, and four of Newt's business/political associates. Marianne accused him of transferring assets before seeking a divorce. Marianne requested and a judge granted a videotaped deposition of a 33-year-old Congressional aide, Callista Bisek, with whom Newt was alleged to have had an affair.
Mrs. Gingrich than filed to depose her husband's close political and business associates. She sought to depose Callista Bisek, Newt's alleged mistress, and four of Newt's business/political associates. Marianne accused him of transferring assets before seeking a divorce.
Newt countered with an attempt to blame his wife for the marriage collapse, demanding she be deposed and accusing her of withholding money. Gingrich then filed several motions focusing on the part that Marianne played in the breakdown of the marriage, demanding that she turn over money that he claimed she was hoarding and asking her to respond to 26 questions for discovery evidence.
In July 1999, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich filed for divorce from his second wife, Marianne, after eighteen years of marriage amid allegations he was having an affair with a congressional aide, Callista Bisek. It was at that time that Gingrich began an affair with Callista Bisek an aide for the House Agriculture Committee 23 years younger than he. Marianne requested and a judge granted a videotaped deposition of a 33-year-old Congressional aide, Callista Bisek, with whom Newt was alleged to have had an affair.
Callista Bizek was not deposed but agreed to reveal some, but not all, of Newt's gifts and turned over some documents. Ms. Bisek protested the subpoena on grounds of self-incrimination but agreed to reveal gifts and money that Gingrich spent on her.
Marianne counterclaimed that Gingrich had transferred or concealed some assets before filing for the divorce. Marianne filed a counterclaim asking a judge to freeze the couple's assets accusing Newt of transferring assets before filing for divorce. Mrs. Gingrich filed court papers accusing Gingrich of trying to transfer assets before the divorce filing. Marianne accused him of transferring assets before seeking a divorce.
In May 1999 Newt Gingrich told his wife he was seeing another woman and wanted a divorce. He separated from his wife in May and filed for divorce in July.
On July 29, 1999 Newt Gingrich filed for divorce from his wife of 18 years, Marianne, declaring the marriage "irretrievably broken". Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich filed for divorce from his wife, Marianne, of 18 years saying the marriage is "irretrievably broken".
Newt responded by calling on Marianne to sit for a videotaped deposition and to account for all the couple's cash and stocks, suggesting that she had evaded their confidential financial agreement. Newt countered with an attempt to blame his wife for the marriage collapse, demanding she be deposed and accusing her of withholding money. Gingrich began playing hardball and demanded that Marianne sit for a videotape deposition just as she had demanded of Callista.
Bisek admitted their six-year affair, but refused to comply when Marianne's attorney subpoenaed various gifts, letters and documents. Marianne sought to depose Callista in order to confirm the nature of her affair with Gingrich and continued to press for the deposition even after the adulterous pair had conceded their long-standing affair.
Ultimately, the Gingriches ended the divorce proceedings with a private tentative agreement on December 16, 1999. Outstanding legal issues were never settled since after going to mandatory mediation, the Gingriches reached "full settlement" on Dec. 16.
Eventually Newt and Marianne Gingrich appeared for a court-ordered mediation session in Cobb County, Georgia. In December 1999 a court-ordered mediation was held.
After 12 hours of negotiation the couple agreed to a settlement. The mediator, after 12 hours of negotiation, reached an agreement for a "full settlement".
The drug combination can cause breathing difficulty, sore throat, rashes, itching, nausea, insomnia, anemia, anorexia and occasionally birth defects.

Interferon alpha-2b is used to treat viral diseases, including Ebola, and is also used to treat some cancer. It is used to treat hepatitis, multiple sclerosis, and cancer. It is in the early stages of study in the treatment of cancer with some promising results.
It is proving effective in the treatment of liver diseases hepatitis C and hepatitis B, multiple sclerosis, and life-threatening tumors. On the positive side, it has saved the lives of many children with life-threatening tumors called hemangiomas for which no other cancer treatment had worked. Interferon has also saved many children with life threatening growths, called hemangiomas by its ability to knock out a tumor's ability to recruit blood vessels from nearby tissues.
It is proving effective in the treatment of liver diseases hepatitis C and hepatitis B, multiple sclerosis, and life-threatening tumors.

Interferon alone eliminates hepatitis C in about 10-20 percent of patients, about 50 percent do not respond, while the remaining 30-40 percent respond and then relapse. It eliminates the disease in only 10-20% of patients and about half of those treated do not respond at all.
It has been used most prominently either alone or in combination with ribavirin to treat liver disease, particularly hepatitis B and hepatitis C, but has also been effective in stopping the growth of giant-cell tumors. A frequent hepatitis C treatment is by Rebetron, a combination of interferon injections and ribavirin capsules, which eliminates hepatitis C symptoms in twice as many patients as interferon alone. Until recently, it was the only treatment for hepatitis but now there is a new treatment approach involving combinations of interferon and ribavirin. A more effective treatment for hepatitis C was to use the drug ribavarin in combination with Interferon.

About 200 FBI, state, and local officials began searching the remote densely forested area employing helicopters, dogs, and survival-training volunteers.
He is an experienced survivalist, knows the area well, has altered his identity by growing a beard and long hair, and is probably hiding in one of the area's hundreds of caves or mines. Rudolph has eluded police for three years. It was thought that Rudolph, an accomplished sportsman and survivalist, was able to hide in inaccessible mines or caves while stealing food for sustenance.
In October 1997 Congress overrode the president's line-item veto against 36 of 38 military construction projects. The affected items were projects for specific localities, many in the area of military construction, which had been added to the president's budget by Congress. He used it 163 times, mostly to delete items from the military construction bill. President Clinton used the authority to veto 82 items in 11 bills, including money for New York hospitals, a tax break for Idaho potato growers, 38 projects worth $287M in military construction, $144M from a defense spending bill and $30M for intercepting asteroids.
It was considered in line with the historic relationship between Congress and the president and would provide a tool for eliminating wasteful pork barrel spending while enlivening debate over the best use of funds. The line-item veto (LIV) has been sought by nearly every president this century as a tool to limit pork barrel spending which is traditionally reviled as the most cynically deployed and least utilitarian form of largess.
It was argued that the LIV would represent presidential exercise of spending authority delegated by Congress. Proponents argued that the law preserved the integrity of federal spending, saved billions of dollars, and that it did not repeal any portion of a law, but was simply a delegated spending authorization from Congress. The Solicitor General contended that the LIV represents a presidential exercise of spending authority delegated by Congress.
Proponents argued that the law preserved the integrity of federal spending, saved billions of dollars, and that it did not repeal any portion of a law, but was simply a delegated spending authorization from Congress. President Clinton exercised the LIV on 82 items in 1997 saving $1.9 billion in spending projected over five years.
A Republican-controlled Congress passed the Line-Item Veto Act which went into effect January 1997. In January 1997, the first year of the law, the president vetoed 163 line-items in six bills, and in 1998 82 line-items in 11 bills.
In the words of President Clinton the line item veto "is very important in helping to preserve the integrity of federal spending". President Clinton said the LIV is an important tool for striking unnecessary spending, for preserving the integrity of federal spending and enlivening the public debate over how to make the best use of public funds. Congress passed a law authorizing the line item veto (LIV) in 1996 accepting arguments that the measure would help preserve the integrity of federal spending by allowing the president to strike unnecessary spending and tax items from legislation thus encouraging the government to live within its means.

The line-item veto (LIV) has been sought by nearly every president this century as a tool to limit pork barrel spending which is traditionally reviled as the most cynically deployed and least utilitarian form of largess. The line item veto has been sought by presidents since Grant and was popularized by Reagan.
Congress passed a law authorizing the line item veto (LIV) in 1996 accepting arguments that the measure would help preserve the integrity of federal spending by allowing the president to strike unnecessary spending and tax items from legislation thus encouraging the government to live within its means. It was part of Republican "Contract with America" led by Speaker Newt Gingrich that enacted it. A Republican-controlled Congress passed the Line-Item Veto Act which went into effect January 1997. In 1996 a Republican congress overwhelmingly passed a Line Item Veto Act allowing presidents (including the incumbent Democratic president), to strike individual tax or spending items within 5 days after signing a bill into law.

On June 25, 1998 after lower courts rejected the Line Item Veto Act as unconstitutional, on appeal by the White House the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that Congress unconstitutionally violated the principle of separation of powers, because that procedure allows the president to create a law that was not voted on by either house of Congress in violation of the Constitution's Article I "presentment" clause. The Justice Department appealed that decision to the Supreme Court. The Department of Justice appealed that decision and in June 1998 the Supreme Court ruled the LIV act unconstitutional but on the grounds that it violated Article I, 7, Clause 2 (The "presentment clause") of the Constitution that establishes the process by which a bill becomes law.

The Line-Item Veto Act was overturned by U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in April 1997 and later ruled 6-3 as unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court because it allows the president to alter a law after passage, thereby creating a new law not voted on by either house of Congress.

Two thirds of US medical schools teach acupuncture.
With a history of more than 2000 years, acupuncture is a major part of an Asian tradition of medicine. Acupuncture is the ancient Chinese medical therapy technique of inserting thin, sharpened needles into specific nerve junction points of the body.
Doctors, hospitals, medical centers and senior centers in the United States are increasingly integrating alternative and traditional medicines. As the trend grows towards a, "complementary" medical model, hospitals, medical centers and senior centers are exploring the prospects of integrating conventional Western medical approaches with Eastern therapies including acupuncture. It was often part of alternative medical treatments that began becoming available at an increasing number of conventional hospitals and health-care organizations.
Acupuncture was also being used to treat apoplexy, high blood pressure, weight problems, bedwetting, and infertility; and for cosmetic surgery for face lifts and to remove lines around the eyes and wrinkles about the mouth. Acupuncture has also been used for cosmetic therapy, addictions, weight problems, bedwetting, and acne.
In November 1997, The National Institutes of Health gave an unprecedented endorsement of acupuncture. In November 1997 a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored panel concluded for the first time that there is clear evidence that acupuncture effectively treats pain after surgery or dental procedures and controls nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy or pregnancy. The US National Institute of Health in 1997 found that acupuncture is an effective treatment for pain after surgery or dental procedures and for controlling nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy or pregnancy.

His second attempt began January 28, 1998. Swiss balloonist Bertand Piccard was forced to abandon his first attempt to circumnavigate the world non-stop in a balloon six hours after take-off because of a fuel leak, January 12, 1997. Piccard had made two previous attempts at the feat in 1997 and 1998 with two differing teams--the first was abandoned after only six hours aloft because of a hazardous fuel leak; the second attempt was aborted after the balloon was denied permission to fly through China's airspace. Swiss psychiatrist Bertrand Piccard, from a family of explorers, made three attempts at the first balloon circumnavigation of the earth. After weeks of delays trying to get fly-over permission from China, Piccard and British balloonist Brian Jones took off from Chateau d'Oex in the Swiss Alps on March 1, 1999 for a third attempt.
The pilots were worried that they might not have enough fuel to reach the finish line, but found favorable winds to carry them across the Atlantic. They picked up another jet stream, and on March 19, beat the endurance record set just two weeks before.
