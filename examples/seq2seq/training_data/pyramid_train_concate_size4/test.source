The issue stems from the alleged recruitment of GM's eccentric and visionary Basque-born procurement chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortura and seven of Lopez's business colleagues. Lopez, disappointed that GM was not going to build a plant in his native Basque country, left GM under a cloud of confusion and allegedly took some sensitive GM documents and plans with him. Lopez was disappointed by GM's decision not to build an automobile plant in his own Basque country. Lopez had developed a new GM plant to be built in his native Basque country, but when he learned in March 1993 that it would be built in Hungary he abruptly left GM for VW, with secret GM documents he had requested that detailed GM's new plant and car models.
Lopez was procurement chief at Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary. He was made procurement chief at GM headquarters. Jose Lopez as head of purchasing at Adam Opel, GMs German subsidiary, led the company to become the most profitable car maker in that country.

Jose Lopez as head of purchasing at Adam Opel, GMs German subsidiary, led the company to become the most profitable car maker in that country. Lopez was procurement chief at Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary. On March 16, 1993, with Japanese car import quotas to Europe expiring in two years, renowned cost-cutter, Agnacio Lopes De Arriortua, left his job as head of purchasing at General Motor's Opel,Germany, to become Volkswagen's Purchasing and Production Director. The industrial espionage case involving GM and VW began with the hiring of Jose Ignacio Lopez, an employee of GM subsidiary Adam Opel, by VW as production director.
Ferdinand Piech had just been installed as Chairman of Volkswagen when he hired Lopez. A ruthless restructurer, he recruited General Motors' likeminded global head of purchasing Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. VW chairman Ferdinand Piech recruited the General Motors/Opel executive, Jose Lopez de Arriortua. He was presumably recruited by VW chairman, Ferdinand Piech, who was impressed with Lopez's leading role in helping Adam Opel recover from a major production cost disadvantage.
Lopez, disappointed that GM was not going to build a plant in his native Basque country, left GM under a cloud of confusion and allegedly took some sensitive GM documents and plans with him. Lopez also requested documents from Adam Opel that later turned up in the Wiesbaden home of a Lopez colleague who followed him to VW. The investigation is focused mainly on evidence that Mr. Lopez and his associates took GM and Adam Opel industrial secrets with them. Lopez had developed a new GM plant to be built in his native Basque country, but when he learned in March 1993 that it would be built in Hungary he abruptly left GM for VW, with secret GM documents he had requested that detailed GM's new plant and car models.
These included details of Opel's entire European component supplier network and key contact data, plans for a new style, low-cost high-speed car factory, and information on new models. Lopez had developed a new GM plant to be built in his native Basque country, but when he learned in March 1993 that it would be built in Hungary he abruptly left GM for VW, with secret GM documents he had requested that detailed GM's new plant and car models. The situation became more serious when top- secret documents were found missing from GM that described plans to build a new model car. Then state prosecution officials discovered four boxes of papers, including secrets documents containing plans to build the car where Gutierrez and Piazza, another former GM employee were staying.
GM immediately accused Lopez of looting Opel's supply network and contract database and taking secret plans for a high-speed factory and a new Opel mini-car.

Still Later German police raided VW headquarters and seized documents that were later founds to contain Opel plans.
Then state prosecution officials discovered four boxes of papers, including secrets documents containing plans to build the car where Gutierrez and Piazza, another former GM employee were staying. In four remaining boxes, investigators found details of Opel secret car plans.
German officials began investigating VW for theft and industrial espionage. The investigation is focused mainly on evidence that Mr. Lopez and his associates took GM and Adam Opel industrial secrets with them. Darmstadt, Germany investigator, Dorothea Holland, launched still unresolved investigations into charges of industrial espionage, theft, and perjury against Lopez, his 22-year old daughter, Begounia, and other GM colleagues now at VW. At GM's request, German state prosecutors and the FBI began investigations into industrial espionage, theft, perjury and wire fraud.
In May, 1994, Lopez agreed to pay 29,850 pounds to avoid facing perjury charges in court. Lopez was accused of perjury and in May 1994 agreed, while maintaining his innocence, to pay a DM75,000 fine to avoid facing charges in court The German prosecutor, Dorthea Holland, was searching through an estimated 2 million computer printout sheets. Darmstadt, Germany investigator, Dorothea Holland, launched still unresolved investigations into charges of industrial espionage, theft, and perjury against Lopez, his 22-year old daughter, Begounia, and other GM colleagues now at VW.

These included details of Opel's entire European component supplier network and key contact data, plans for a new style, low-cost high-speed car factory, and information on new models. GM charged that during his last months at GM, Lopez stole GM plans for ultra-low cost factories; designs for advanced cars and engines; and information about Opel's suppliers and parts.
He was presumably recruited by VW chairman, Ferdinand Piech, who was impressed with Lopez's leading role in helping Adam Opel recover from a major production cost disadvantage. Jose Lopez as head of purchasing at Adam Opel, GMs German subsidiary, led the company to become the most profitable car maker in that country.
The FBI opened still unresolved investigations of wire and mail fraud against VW and Lopez. The U.S. Justice Department's interest in industrial espionage had been piqued and the FBI began an investigation of mail and wire fraud, which was also stalled. The case reached the highest levels in both countries including the US Justice Dept. and the FBI investigating mail and wire fraud. The FBI is probing possible mail and wire fraud.

With GM urging, a temporary injunction was imposed on VW recruiting, but it was subsequently lifted and manager-poaching claims against VW were rejected. A regional court in Frankfurt issued an injunction preventing VW from recruiting more GM staff. VW was banned from further personnel poaching but a Frankfurt court denied that poaching broke fair competition rules.
All charges of anti-competitive staff poaching were later dismissed.

VW was banned from further personnel poaching but a Frankfurt court denied that poaching broke fair competition rules.
He saw Lopez as the answer to a similar ongoing problem at VW. Ferdinand Piech took over an ailing VW company that was losing money. Ferdinand Piech became Volkswagen chairman in January 1993 and planned to turn the money-losing company around.
Coincidentally, Lopez quit after being informed that a plan to install his new car dream plant in his Basque area was cancelled. Lopez was disappointed by GM's decision not to build an automobile plant in his own Basque country. Lopez had developed a new GM plant to be built in his native Basque country, but when he learned in March 1993 that it would be built in Hungary he abruptly left GM for VW, with secret GM documents he had requested that detailed GM's new plant and car models.

Darmstadt, Germany investigator, Dorothea Holland, launched still unresolved investigations into charges of industrial espionage, theft, and perjury against Lopez, his 22-year old daughter, Begounia, and other GM colleagues now at VW.
Months of charges and counter-charges followed and details were aired in German newspapers. A court case was also brought against leading news magazine, Der Spiegel, for making public allegations of spying against Lopez.
However, he left GM for VW under circumstances, which along with ensuing events, were described by a German judge as "potentially the biggest-ever case of industrial espionage". Lopez, disappointed that GM was not going to build a plant in his native Basque country, left GM under a cloud of confusion and allegedly took some sensitive GM documents and plans with him.
All charges of anti-competitive staff poaching were later dismissed. VW was banned from further personnel poaching but a Frankfurt court denied that poaching broke fair competition rules. VW and Lopez also were accused on conducting an illegal recruiting campaign. When GM protested the recruiting of their employees, private mediation was set up between the two companies.

In 1994, Britian's Prince Andrew made an official royal visit and Carlos Bastos, Argentine energy minister, went to London. In 1994 Britain's Duke of York was the first official royal visitor to Argentina. Prince Andrew visited in 1994.
Argentina and Great Britain are cooperating on the building and use of two nuclear power stations. That country hopes to attract UK investment in its nuclear industry and would have no objection to British companies operating its nuclear power stations. Other economic areas included livestock techniques, privatization of Argentina's nuclear industry, and sharing of fishing resources. UK's Babcock International supplied inspection equipment to an Argentine nuclear power station.
In early 1990, both countries agreed to restore full diplomatic ties and GB lifted a 150-mile military protection zone enforced around the islands. Diplomatic relations resumed in 1990, and trade and investment between the two increased substantially. Full diplomatic relations were re-established in 1990, after Argentine president Carlos Menem took office. Full diplomatic ties were resumed in February 1990.
President Carlos Menem of Argentina who took office in 1989 has adopted a pro-western foreign policy and free market economics.

Argentina was still obsessed with the Falkland Islands even in 1994, 12 years after its defeat in the 74-day war with Britain. In 1985 Britain ended trade curbs imposed on Argentina after the 1982 Falklands conflict. The return to normal relations between the United Kingdom and Argentina has been gradual since the end of the 1982 Falklands War.
Throughout 1993, a series of British high-level officials visited Argentina; notably, UK foreign secretary Douglas Hurd, the UK trade and industry secretary, and UK agriculture minister, Gillian Shephard, Argentina's economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, and its foreign minister, Guido di Tella, visited London.

Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo and Foreign Minister Guido De Tella went to the UK. These developments were followed by a visit to London by Guido di Tella, Argentine foreign minister, to hold financial and trade discussions. Diplomatic relations have continued to improve with state visits to Argentina by foreign secretary Douglas Hurd and a year later a visit to Britain by foreign minister Guido di Tella of Argentina.
Militarily, both countries joined forces to support the first Iraq war. Britain's arms embargo continues, except for Argentine units participating with Gulf War Coalition forces. Although the UK and Argentina cooperated militarily during the Gulf War, Britain has maintained an arm embargo preventing Argentina from replacing aircraft shot down in the Falklands War. Britain and Argentina co-operated during the 1991 Gulf War and Argentine units received UK-manufactured spare parts.
In December 1992, a British consortium bought out the Buenos Aires gas distribution company. British Gas bought into and managed Argentine gas distribution. A consortium led by British Gas bought the largest gas distribution company in Argentina. By 1991, British Gas was involved in gas production and distribution.

In February 1992, both countries began discussions in Buenos Aires on developing South Atlantic oil resources. The two countries planned to develop oil resources in the South Atlantic jointly. Joint exploration was being discussed.
Argentina wants UK regulatory expertise in privatization and private sector investment in Argentina's gas and nuclear industries. Argentina has sought British assistance on privatization of the oil and gas industries and the development of oil resources.
Menem claimed rapprochement with Britain rather than confrontation would restore Argentina's Falklands sovereignty by 2000. Argentina's overriding aim is to regain sovereignty. Argentina's main objective remains recovering sovereignty of the Falklands, thinking economic links would reduce the Falkland's importance to Britain. The country's overriding foreign policy aim continued to be winning sovereignty over the islands.
In early 1990, both countries agreed to restore full diplomatic ties and GB lifted a 150-mile military protection zone enforced around the islands. Britain did lift the 150-mile military protection zone around the Falklands in 1990, but the UK arms embargo, begun in 1982, continued through 1994. A British-imposed military protection zone around the Falklands was removed. Britain lifted military protection zones around the islands.
Britain had hoped to strike an agreement with Argentina that would protect the islands' revenues, but Argentina tied such an agreement to concessions by London over shared development of the islands' possible oil reserves and lifting of the UK's arms embargo. Argentina used fishing disputes to press for oil and military compromises.
Some differences and even anger exist between Argentina and Britain over territorial sea claims and fishing rights in the South Atlantic. Britain extended territorial waters into disputed areas.
Argentina was still obsessed with the Falkland Islands even in 1994, 12 years after its defeat in the 74-day war with Britain. Thirteen years after the war between Britain and Argentina over the Falkland Islands, Argentina still makes a ritual reference to Argentina's sovereignty over those islands. Argentine-British relations since the Falkland Islands War in 1982 have gradually improved.
Argentine officer training at British academies resumed. Talks over resuming training Argentine officers in UK military academies were planned The two nations agree to disagree over the sovereignty of the Falklands. Argentine military officers train in the UK.
Argentina pressed for greater involvement in developing Falklands' natural resources, and in 1991, the UK agreed to cooperate to conserve fisheries. A 1993 fisheries conservation agreement changed Argentine policies which threatened depletion of fragile fish populations.
Argentines visit war cemeteries in the Falklands. Argentinians visited war cemeteries in the Falklands and Scotland Yard investigated British war crimes in Argentina.
Each side would announce upcoming military exercises. Each side gives advance notice of military exercises.
In 1994 Britain indicated readiness for Argentine companies to participate in Falkland's off-shore oil development. Oil and gasfields detected in disputed waters required Argentine cooperation for development, but Britain claimed ownership of any oil.
Also in 1994, Britain's Export Credit Guarantee Department began underwriting loans to Argentina again. Britain's Export Credit Guarantee Department resumed insurance for exports to Argentina. Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department resumed insurance cover to Argentina.
In 1993, several high level visits were exchanged. In late 1992 and early the next year, major cabinet ministers visited each other countries. Reciprocal ministerial visits followed. Throughout 1993, a series of British high-level officials visited Argentina; notably, UK foreign secretary Douglas Hurd, the UK trade and industry secretary, and UK agriculture minister, Gillian Shephard, Argentina's economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, and its foreign minister, Guido di Tella, visited London.
Argentine-British relations since the Falkland Islands War in 1982 have gradually improved. Relations between Argentina and Britain began improving after President Carlos Menem took office in 1989 and adopted pro-western foreign policies and free market economics. In most other areas, relations between the two countries have steadily improved. Although there are still remaining issues regarding the Falkland Islands, relations between Argentina and Great Britain are growing continuously cooperative.
This remains the only issue that seriously divides the two nations. Although there are still remaining issues regarding the Falkland Islands, relations between Argentina and Great Britain are growing continuously cooperative.

Philip Morris also bought a factory in Czechoslovakia. Philip Morris set up operations in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, near St. Petersburg, Russia, Krakow, Poland, and Turkey. PM acquired equity in Czechoslovakia. Phillip Morris also brokered deals in Eastern Europe including Hungary (aiming to export to the Ukraine), Romania, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Poland and eastern Germany.
At the same time East European and Asian markets opened up with the fall of the Soviet Union and the lifting of trade restrictions. However, their sales assault overseas; namely, the Far East, has provided a burgeoning increase in profits. Asian markets, especially Japan, Taiwan and China, were also pursued.
It cut US prices to restore Marlboro's US standing. In the U.S. PM lowered Marlboro cigarette prices to increase U.S. market share, and bolster Marlboro's image for global marketing; and increased U.S. production by 50% for overseas sales.
In Hungary PM increased cigarette exports to Ukraine. That factory would send cigarettes to Ukraine.
The company plans to begin producing Marlboros in Russia. Philip Morris expected to start producing Marlboros in Russia in 1993.
RJR plans to produce Camels and other brands in Kazakhstan. R.J. Reynolds planned to produce Camels and other brands in a joint venture in Kazakhstan by late 1992.
Despite continuing anti-smoking pressures from domestic private and public sources and a loss of profits in a price war in 1993, US tobacco companies appear capable of sustaining strong momentum. American cigarette manufacturing companies faced with declining sales because of health concerns regarding cigarettes and restrictions on advertising began to diversify and acquire companies that produce non-tobacco products. Although the domestic market for cigarettes in America in the l990s was greatly reduced due to bans on advertising, smoking in public places, and health warnings, American tobacco companies were showing a profit most quarters due to export sales of cigarettes and diversification of products sold including food. As smoking lost acceptance in the United States, US cigarette producers fought to survive.
The tobacco industry initially has responded with intense advertising, lobbying in Washington, and using cash flow from tobacco operations to finance diversification into food industries. American cigarette manufacturing companies faced with declining sales because of health concerns regarding cigarettes and restrictions on advertising began to diversify and acquire companies that produce non-tobacco products. They formed or joined multi-national conglomerates and pursued international tobacco markets as communism fell and monopolies were relaxed.
Philip Morris advertised intensely and invested heavily to increase production and crops worldwide. The tobacco industry initially has responded with intense advertising, lobbying in Washington, and using cash flow from tobacco operations to finance diversification into food industries.

RJR Nabisco added volume in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. RJR Nabisco acquired factory interests in Hungary, Kazakhstan, Poland, Russia, Turkey, the Ukraine, and China.
It also moved into former Soviet states, building a factory in Lithuania and acquiring controlling of a Kazakhstan factory. In Asia, Philip Morris opened a plant in Kazakhstan with an eye to opening in Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Thailand, and particularly China, the biggest world market, as trade restrictions are lifted. It also acquired production interests in Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, and China, and expanded its NC plant. The company also gained control of a Kazakhstan cigarette manufacturing operation.
Although the domestic market for cigarettes in America in the l990s was greatly reduced due to bans on advertising, smoking in public places, and health warnings, American tobacco companies were showing a profit most quarters due to export sales of cigarettes and diversification of products sold including food. PM often entered markets with both cigarettes and food.
Two U.S. tobacco companies, Phillip Morris and RJ Reynolds, used aggressive, long-term strategies, beyond export sales, to capture new international tobacco markets which privatization had expanded from 60% closed to 95% open. To expand markets abroad in the early 1990s, American tobacco companies took advantage of weak advertising restrictions, trade barrier removal, and state tobacco monopoly liberalization, in China, Soviet Union, Japan, Eastern Europe, South Korea, France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Thailand, Taiwan, and Portugal. Two American companies moved quickly into these markets, RJ Reynolds and particularly, Philip Morris. These same companies realized that a lucrative market for tobacco products existed overseas, especially in the countries of the former Soviet Union and those in the Soviet bloc.

They bought into or built factories to produce both western and local brands. US/multinational companies partnered with foreign cigarette manufacturers and distributors. Philip Morris used a strategy of buying large shares of existing cigarette manufacturing facilities in Eastern Europe and opening new plants. So, American tobacco companies began to increase marketing overseas and invest in foreign cigarette or initiate cigarette production in foreign countries.
Their parent companies, PM and RJR Nabisco, both fared well from outstanding quarterly profit increases from their international tobacco operations, more than from their other divisions. Although the domestic market for cigarettes in America in the l990s was greatly reduced due to bans on advertising, smoking in public places, and health warnings, American tobacco companies were showing a profit most quarters due to export sales of cigarettes and diversification of products sold including food. International sales and company profits increased steadily. Phillip Morris' success was revealed by its increase in exports (24.4% in 1990), overseas sales gains (24% in 2d quarter 1991), and rising international tobacco profits (19.9% in 1992).
America's tobacco companies -- namely, Phillip Morris (PM), R. J. Reynolds (RJR), BAT Industries, and Rothman's International -- have taken a more aggressive approach to selling cigarettes. Two U.S. tobacco companies, Phillip Morris and RJ Reynolds, used aggressive, long-term strategies, beyond export sales, to capture new international tobacco markets which privatization had expanded from 60% closed to 95% open.
The opening of new markets abroad is due to the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, China's new open-market policy, the breaking of cigarette monopolies in Western Europe, and an increase in smoking habits in Asia. In Asia, Philip Morris opened a plant in Kazakhstan with an eye to opening in Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Thailand, and particularly China, the biggest world market, as trade restrictions are lifted.
Cyanide is used in mining to extract precious metals from low-grade ore. Cyanide is used extensively in gold mining through a system called "heap leach" mining, which enables microscopic bits of gold to be economically extracted from low-grade ore. Cyanide is used in mining to recover metal from low-yielding ore. In mining industry applications a 0.1% cyanide-water solution cheaply leaches metals, such as gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead and iron from ore heaps.
Cyanide is used in tryptophan production. The Japanese use hydrogen cyanide to manufacture tryptophan, an amino acid used as a nutritional supplement. Hydrogen cyanide has been used to produce amino acid nutritional supplements. Another use of cyanide is in manufacturing the nutritional supplement tryptophan.
Sodium cyanide use by fisherman decimates fish. Philippine fishermen use cyanide in fishing, needlessly destroying immature fish. Fisheries in parts of the Philippines have been decimated by the use of cyanide in fishing.

This method decimates the fish population and is linked to the destruction of area reefs. Some Filipinos use cyanide in dangerous and destructive (to coral reefs) fishing operations.
In Cameroon, a pygmy tribe uses smoking leaves and a cyanide compound for stunning bees while retrieving honey. Cyanide-leaching recovers silver from photographic film; is used to make PCP; and in Cameroon, pygmies harvest honey stun bees with cyanide-laced smoke. Cameroon honey gatherers use cyanide to stun bees. Climbers stun the bees with smoking leaves and a cyanide compound.
In Cameroon, a pygmy tribe uses smoking leaves and a cyanide compound for stunning bees while retrieving honey. An unusual use of cyanide is to assist Cameroon villagers to gather honey from hives in tall trees.
Other uses for cyanide are in galvanizing and other metal plating, in recovering silver from photographs and x-rays, and in fishing. Cyanide is used in the metal plating industry and to recover silver from used film. Cyanide-leaching recovers silver from photographic film; is used to make PCP; and in Cameroon, pygmies harvest honey stun bees with cyanide-laced smoke.
Other uses for cyanide are in galvanizing and other metal plating, in recovering silver from photographs and x-rays, and in fishing. Cyanide is used widely for many purposes but most extensively in gold, silver, and copper mining, in electroplating, x-ray film recovery, and in the production of pharmaceuticals. Cyanide used to recover silver from X-ray film caused the death of a worker when he inhaled fumes from the process. Cyanide is used to extract silver from used x-ray films.
In some isolated cases, it is used for fishing and food gathering. Other uses for cyanide are in galvanizing and other metal plating, in recovering silver from photographs and x-rays, and in fishing.
A film recovery worker died from inhaling cyanide fumes. In 1990, a worker died recovering silver from X-rays. Cyanide used to recover silver from X-ray film caused the death of a worker when he inhaled fumes from the process. An employee at one of these plants died after inhaling cyanide fumes on the job.
Cyanide is used in the metal plating industry, where the storage tanks pose a risk of deadly hydrogen cyanide being accidentally released. Other uses for cyanide are in galvanizing and other metal plating, in recovering silver from photographs and x-rays, and in fishing. Cyanide is used in the metal plating industry and to recover silver from used film. Plating companies electroplate metal, such as that used by military and aerospace contractors, by placing it in large cyanide and acid baths.
There is a reported incident of five workers in Indiana dying of asphyxiation when working in an enclosed space in the presence of the cyanide gas. Five young men working in a California plating plant died in 1989 from inhaling cyanide fumes in a confined space. Five plating company workers died when hydrogen cyanide gas was accidentally created while cleaning a holding tank. Cyanide fumes killed five workers cleaning one tank.
The heap-leach technique uses a water-cyanide solution to dissolve gold, silver, or copper from the ore. Cost efficient "heap-leach technology," using cyanide, revolutionized gold mining in the 1970s. The first use in the mining industry, known as heap leaching, is a very economical and efficient way to separate small traces of gold from rock. A process known as heap-leach or heap mining is used to extract gold from low-grade ore.

Gold mining operations make extensive use of cyanide. Cost efficient "heap-leach technology," using cyanide, revolutionized gold mining in the 1970s.
The dangers of cyanide use in gold mining are its potential for environmental contamination. Environmental problems arise during times of heavy rainfall when ponds overflow and run into natural streams. Mine waste-water poses an environmental hazard. In mining, open ponds of cyanide and toxic metal waste, leak or flood into the environment.
If toxic waste containing cyanide is not disposed of properly, it may drain into ponds, streams, sewers, and reservoirs. Leaks contaminate waterways and groundwater. Seepage could contaminate ground water. Waste ponds foul the air, and water leaks into streams, poisoning the fish and contaminating water.
In Summitville Colorado, pollution from a mountain mine killed fish for 17 miles and corroded irrigation equipment. A leak into the Alamosa River poisoned fish in a downstream reservoir and corroded irrigation equipment in the valley. Flora, fauna and humans die from direct contact with concentrated waste; which then flows into tributaries, rivers, lakes and reservoirs, resulting in massive kills of fish, animals and plants, and corrosion of irrigation equipment even 17 miles or more down stream, before cyanide is diluted or deactivated by sunlight. Within a year it had poisoned all the fish in a reservoir 15 miles downstream and threatened irrigation in the valley below.
A leak into the Alamosa River poisoned fish in a downstream reservoir and corroded irrigation equipment in the valley. In Colorado, in 1994, a mine leaked contaminated water into the Alamosa River.
The ore is spread on impermeable plastic pads then sprinkled with a weak cyanide-water mixture. Ore is placed on a plastic pad and a weak cyanide solution is poured over it to pull the gold from the rock. Crushed ore is heaped on an impermeable pad and saturated with a cyanide solution that leaches out metal then drains into a holding pond. On huge plastic pads, heaps of pulverized ore from strip mines are saturated with a cyanide solution.
In this cost effective method, cyanide bonds to bits of gold and the solution is then drained into holding ponds where the gold separates out. The waste from this process is discharged into self-contained ponds. The solution-coated ore is then drained into a holding pond where the gold is separated from the solution. Crushed ore is heaped on an impermeable pad and saturated with a cyanide solution that leaches out metal then drains into a holding pond.
Evaporation from cyanide waste ponds affects breathing. Waste ponds foul the air, and water leaks into streams, poisoning the fish and contaminating water. Water in a waste pond in Mojkovak, Montenegro, gave off a mist that affected people's breathing and caused a doubling of lung cancer cases in the two years prior to February, 1992. In Montenegro, waste reservoir mists affected people's breathing.
A plating company in Hollywood, California was charged with dumping cyanide into the sewer system and with reckless storage of chemicals. Cyanide-contaminated sludge has been dumped into a Brazilian river and California sewers and trash bins. In Los Angeles, dumping of thousands of gallons of cyanide solution from plating operations into sewers occurred several times in 1989 and 1990. Environmental damage occurred when a leaking holding tank contaminated ground water and when a plating company dumped cyanide-laced waste water into the Los Angeles sewer system.
In Summitville Colorado, pollution from a mountain mine killed fish for 17 miles and corroded irrigation equipment. Flora, fauna and humans die from direct contact with concentrated waste; which then flows into tributaries, rivers, lakes and reservoirs, resulting in massive kills of fish, animals and plants, and corrosion of irrigation equipment even 17 miles or more down stream, before cyanide is diluted or deactivated by sunlight. Within a year it had poisoned all the fish in a reservoir 15 miles downstream and threatened irrigation in the valley below.
Water diverted for mining use can dry surrounding wells and streams, destroying wildlife habitats. Diversion of water for leaching destroys wildlife habitats.
Cyanide is used in electroplating aircraft parts. Plating companies electroplate metal, such as that used by military and aerospace contractors, by placing it in large cyanide and acid baths.
Some mining companies went to a "closed loop" leaching system that does away with open ponds. A pioneering "closed-loop" cyanide leaching system eliminates open ponds and environment leaks.
Thousands of birds and animals die drinking from poisoned waste water ponds. In Nevada, wildlife died by thousands from drinking at cyanide-laced holding ponds. Unfortunately, in some cases runoff from this cyanide process has discharged into ponds with the result that birds and animals were killed. In addition, birds and other wildlife are endangered when they see the open blue cyanide ponds and stop to drink from them.
While the processing systems are generally safe, a number of dangerous situations may occur. Several instances have occurred in which cyanide used by electroplating companies has been improperly stored resulting in dangerous situations and causing expensive clean-ups.
Cyanide is used in pesticides and PCP. Cyanide-leaching recovers silver from photographic film; is used to make PCP; and in Cameroon, pygmies harvest honey stun bees with cyanide-laced smoke.
Waste ponds foul the air, and water leaks into streams, poisoning the fish and contaminating water. Potential dangers are pollution of water supplies, fisheries and air; poisoning of wildlife; lack of mine-operator diligence; and hazardous materials left at abandoned mine sites. A leak into the Alamosa River poisoned fish in a downstream reservoir and corroded irrigation equipment in the valley. This results in the destruction of fish and wildlife or may cause death to humans from breathing poisonous air or drinking contaminated water.
Waste ponds foul the air, and water leaks into streams, poisoning the fish and contaminating water. This results in the destruction of fish and wildlife or may cause death to humans from breathing poisonous air or drinking contaminated water. Environmentalists say the runoff could pollute drinking water and endanger salmon fisheries.

"Me-too" drugs similar to what is already on the market are developed only where there is a market advantage from improved safety, effectiveness or treatment cost-benefit. The drug must pass the hurdles of safety, quality and efficacy. A company then decides which drug to develop, taking into consideration technological feasibility of producing it, whether it will provide significant advantages in safety or efficacy, and likelihood of commercial success. Prospective drugs must have high projected market share; expected superiority in safety, effectiveness, and cost-benefit; and quick profitability or long market life after regulatory approval.
Companies generate public pressure for licensing and try to make applications compelling reading. The process now includes creating public pressure to support the drug, including getting good reviews in medical journals.
The company will go forward with an appealing trade name and an attractive and entertaining application package. Companies generate public pressure for licensing and try to make applications compelling reading.
After the pre-clinical phase, a potential drug goes into clinical trials. This is done with pre-clinical trials, then with clinical trials on humans.
Merck's Clin*Net project allows managers to follow the progress of thousands of patients in clinical centers around the world far more effectively than mail or phone. Doctors and their patients are becoming more reluctant to take part, so companies must spend more time and money to recruit hundreds or thousands of people required. Clinical trial preparation requires recruiting hundreds or thousands of volunteers (including sufficient candidate patients), manufacturing adequate supplies of the drug, and writing case study books.
Drugs must then be licensed for sale, sometimes requiring separate clinical trials in Japan, Europe and the US. This process must be conducted internationally, because US, Japanese and European authorities often require different clinical trials. Profitable drugs are sold worldwide so trials must be conducted in the US, Europe, and Japan.
Considerable data assembled from trials is subjected to detailed statistical evaluation and medical interpretation. Patient data is computerized, evaluated statistically, and interpreted medically.
Pen computers, electronic tablets used for writing on the screen, offer hope for obviating the mountains of paperwork associated with drug trials, especially in Phase II trials, where drugs are tested for efficacy for the first time Finally, drugs must go through expensive licensing procedures in individual countries. Computers are used to keep track of the immense volumes of patient data amassed, to obviate mountains of paperwork, and to cut approval times. In some cases, new timesaving computer processing equipment is being installed which quickly transfers information from paper to computer.
The final phase, the regulatory and licensing process, has become increasingly complex and demanding. Drugs must then be licensed for sale, sometimes requiring separate clinical trials in Japan, Europe and the US.
Volunteers to take the drug must be recruited and detailed records kept and processed to create mountains of supporting documents to submit for licensing approval in a number of countries. Drugs must go through these processes in individual countries at the same time. Pen computers, electronic tablets used for writing on the screen, offer hope for obviating the mountains of paperwork associated with drug trials, especially in Phase II trials, where drugs are tested for efficacy for the first time Finally, drugs must go through expensive licensing procedures in individual countries.
If the compound is not dropped at this point, it is tested for efficacy for the first time. Pen computers, electronic tablets used for writing on the screen, offer hope for obviating the mountains of paperwork associated with drug trials, especially in Phase II trials, where drugs are tested for efficacy for the first time Finally, drugs must go through expensive licensing procedures in individual countries.
The photo is then entered onto a computer screen, where scientists design drugs they believe will react with the target molecule. Using computerized databases, molecular modeling graphics, automatic gene sequencing machines, and x-ray crystallography, they design drugs to react with target molecules.
The pathology of the disease or condition for which the development of a new drug is contemplated must be understood. Drug research and development starts with a decision on which therapeutic area to target, based on medical need, potential market size, and understanding of the disease mechanism.
Research and development of drugs is a complex, drawn-out, and expensive process. The research and development phase for creating new drugs is costly and complicated.
Profits are reinvested for R&D, but other sources include license sales, private investors, government subsidies, divestitures, lay-offs and overhead cuts. Some pharmaceutical companies have cut back on the number of their R&D facilities and, in some cases, have consolidated them all into one location.
Some companies have separated research from development in order to expedite development. There are companies that have split the management of their R&D processes.
Others have cut the number of compounds under development to concentrate efforts on the more promising drugs. Companies are learning to concentrate only on innovative drugs that seem certain to prove effective and to drop research on those taking too long to develop.
There is also increasing use of computerized molecular design methods, which bind molecules to the protein. Now scientists must also have leading-edge computers and are doing molecular modeling and automatic gene sequencing. Using computerized databases, molecular modeling graphics, automatic gene sequencing machines, and x-ray crystallography, they design drugs to react with target molecules. Scientists are using computerized chemical databases, molecular modeling graphics, and automatic gene sequencing machines to rapidly select and adapt compounds for development.
Drug companies make ruthless choices about which of their researched drugs will actually go into development. A company then decides which drug to develop, taking into consideration technological feasibility of producing it, whether it will provide significant advantages in safety or efficacy, and likelihood of commercial success. At this point, drug companies make the decision to develop or not. Companies must decide which compounds to take forward, assessing the medical need and feasibility of each.

Mercy killings usually have taken place when a person on a life-support system is determined to have no chance of recovery. Most mercy killings occur when a patient is in a persistent vegetative state, with no hope of recovery, and family members or guardians request that artificial life support be removed. Passive mercy killings occur when people who are brain-dead or permanently comatose or vegetative after injury, accident or illness are removed from life-support equipment (feeding tubes or respirators).

In most cases, the patient is comatose or mentally unable to communicate his/her feelings and the decision to remove the life-support system is made by relatives in agreement with hospital administrators or upon authority of a local judge. Often, court orders are required to have this done.
Frequently, patients are victims of accidents or crime, such as David Heffer, Tony Bland, Mark Weaver, and Karen Eickholdt. Passive mercy killings occur when people who are brain-dead or permanently comatose or vegetative after injury, accident or illness are removed from life-support equipment (feeding tubes or respirators).

Sustainable development was promoted to exploit the environment without destroying it and create jobs for locals. Brazilian programs to reduce deforestation and CO2 emission, and promote sustainable development include "extractive reserves" which globally market renewable "rain-forest chic" products (replenishable trees, produce, nuts, latex, pharmaceutical plants); discontinuing subsidies to clear-cutting for unsustainable ranches which dislocated forest people; tree improvement; pesticide controls; minimizing roads and mineral mining impacts; increasing fish pond farming; and improving law enforcement. Extractive reserves have been formed for managed harvesting of timber, rubber, Brazil nuts, and medicinal plants without deforestation.
Deforestation is the greatest problem for the rainforest environment and is brought about by logging for valuable hardwood timber, by land stripping for farming and cattle raising, and by road building for access to mining and oil exploration areas. Environmentalists were becoming increasingly concerned about the destruction of the Amazon rainforest during the 1880s. The Amazon rain forest was heavily damaged by deforestation from increasing logging, cattle ranching, farming, mining, roadways, and hydroelectric projects. Deforestation of the Amazon rain forest causes a number of serious environmental problems.
Native trees were planted and protected to preserve biodiversity and natural habitats. The 1992 Earth Summit in Brazil fostered still under-funded first-world commitments to all nine Amazon countries for ecological data banks, forest protection and education programs to reduce global warming and preserve biodiversity, including "debt-for-nature" swaps pending debt relief.
The mountains of Columbia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia face erosion and silting; a crush of oil-rush settlers; illegal cocoa fields with their herbicide and chemical run-offs; the threatened spread of cocoa plantations throughout the entire Amazon basin; and deforestation from out-dated settlement incentives in a hodgepodge of policies and contradictory laws. Illegal coca fields and cocaine processing in the cleared land also pollutes rivers with illegal chemicals. Water, soil and air were polluted by toxic waste from oil operations, logging, goldmining, and cocaine processing. Coca growers' herbicides and refining chemicals wash into rivers.
A major problem resulting from slash and burn agriculture was the reduction of the planet?s oxygen which contributes to global warming. Namely, the slash and burn cycles by ranchers, farmers, loggers, and miners depletes the soil making it impossible to replenish the forest, causes erosion leading to floods or clogging of streams and rivers, or pollutes the water and the air which endangers humans, animals and plant life. Forest-burning for land-clearing or charcoal production reduced Earth's oxygen and added carbon dioxide, contributing to global warming. Many of the environmental problems of the Amazon rainforest result from the slash and burn cycle of clearing used by ranchers and farmers.
The government has halted subsidies to ranchers who were turning forestland into pasture. In order to preserve the rainforest, Brazil ended subsidies to ranchers for forest clearance, and made a law prohibiting landowners from clearing more that 50% of their property. Brazilian programs to reduce deforestation and CO2 emission, and promote sustainable development include "extractive reserves" which globally market renewable "rain-forest chic" products (replenishable trees, produce, nuts, latex, pharmaceutical plants); discontinuing subsidies to clear-cutting for unsustainable ranches which dislocated forest people; tree improvement; pesticide controls; minimizing roads and mineral mining impacts; increasing fish pond farming; and improving law enforcement. Subsidies for ranchers are being removed and timber policies made more restrictive.
Accompanying the reserves are projects for education, technical aid, and financing to help people preserve the forest while benefiting from its riches. Efforts are underway to teach farmers proper harvesting techniques and wean them from the slash and burn cycle.
Examples of good planning are two companies that have planted tree farms in the Amazon, reforesting while creating a profitable harvest. Sustainable forestry and development techniques, such as reforestation, are being employed, and environmental and economic zones have been established to protect threatened species.
Sustainable forestry and development techniques, such as reforestation, are being employed, and environmental and economic zones have been established to protect threatened species. Sustainable development was promoted to exploit the environment without destroying it and create jobs for locals. New programs promote tourism, and sustainable extraction of fibers, fruits and medicinal plants. These include sustainable forestry (using reforestation and leaving surrounding areas intact), the creation of environmental zones to protect species, eco-businesses finding markets for the renewable resources, less intrusive mining methods, and improved government enforcement of laws and patrols of park.
These include sustainable forestry (using reforestation and leaving surrounding areas intact), the creation of environmental zones to protect species, eco-businesses finding markets for the renewable resources, less intrusive mining methods, and improved government enforcement of laws and patrols of park. Sustainable forestry and development techniques, such as reforestation, are being employed, and environmental and economic zones have been established to protect threatened species.
Brazil has also contracted for SIVAM, an elaborate surveillance and communications system to monitor environmental research, for border control and to combat drug trafficking. A technological surveillance system will be built to monitor the Amazon for environmental research. A $139bn Eximbank funded system of radar; airplanes; ground and satellite sensors; and communications networks monitors Brazil's Amazon for environmental research, border control, and drug interdiction. In 1994 Brazil contracted for an Amazon Surveillance System to monitor the environment and assist law enforcement.
A major problem resulting from slash and burn agriculture was the reduction of the planet?s oxygen which contributes to global warming. Forest-burning for land-clearing or charcoal production reduced Earth's oxygen and added carbon dioxide, contributing to global warming. This development is reducing the world oxygen, creating carbon, contributing to global warming, threatening indigenous cultures, and wiping out species.
This development is reducing the world oxygen, creating carbon, contributing to global warming, threatening indigenous cultures, and wiping out species. Namely, the slash and burn cycles by ranchers, farmers, loggers, and miners depletes the soil making it impossible to replenish the forest, causes erosion leading to floods or clogging of streams and rivers, or pollutes the water and the air which endangers humans, animals and plant life. Animal and plant habitats and potentially valuable species were destroyed. Many species of plant and animal life were being destroyed, some before they had even been studied.
In the early 1990s Brazil, which contains the largest area of Amazon forest, the international community, and some businesses began to take action to save the rainforest. This area includes not only the Amazon itself in Brazil, but the headwaters rising in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. The Amazon rain forest is a vast area in South America that includes parts of nine nations, but the greatest part of it is in Brazil.
"Extractable reserves" such as rubber-tapping, fruit and nut gathering have been cited as forms of sustainable development; however, these are of marginal economic return. Extractive reserves have been formed for managed harvesting of timber, rubber, Brazil nuts, and medicinal plants without deforestation. Brazilian programs to reduce deforestation and CO2 emission, and promote sustainable development include "extractive reserves" which globally market renewable "rain-forest chic" products (replenishable trees, produce, nuts, latex, pharmaceutical plants); discontinuing subsidies to clear-cutting for unsustainable ranches which dislocated forest people; tree improvement; pesticide controls; minimizing roads and mineral mining impacts; increasing fish pond farming; and improving law enforcement. Environmental zoning created Indian reservations and "extractive reserves" to exploit forest resources (latex, Brazil nuts, valuable woods, oils, resins, fruits, medicinal plants).
Accompanying the reserves are projects for education, technical aid, and financing to help people preserve the forest while benefiting from its riches. Brazil has established a Foundation for Sustainable Development and a fund for environmental protection, and has suspended tax breaks and credits that once encouraged ranching. Forest management was researched and taught. Numerous research projects in forest management are being funded by Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Bolivia.
The 1992 Earth Summit in Brazil fostered still under-funded first-world commitments to all nine Amazon countries for ecological data banks, forest protection and education programs to reduce global warming and preserve biodiversity, including "debt-for-nature" swaps pending debt relief. The Amazon rain forest is a vast area in South America that includes parts of nine nations, but the greatest part of it is in Brazil.

"Extractable reserves" such as rubber-tapping, fruit and nut gathering have been cited as forms of sustainable development; however, these are of marginal economic return. Additionally, "extractive reserves" are being developed wherein traditional populations can carry out harvesting of traditional products with the aid of processing facilities and the creation of overseas marketing. Brazilian programs to reduce deforestation and CO2 emission, and promote sustainable development include "extractive reserves" which globally market renewable "rain-forest chic" products (replenishable trees, produce, nuts, latex, pharmaceutical plants); discontinuing subsidies to clear-cutting for unsustainable ranches which dislocated forest people; tree improvement; pesticide controls; minimizing roads and mineral mining impacts; increasing fish pond farming; and improving law enforcement.

Ecuador imposed protective requirements on oil exploitation in 200,000 hectares of rainforest, partially in Yasuni national park, a UNESCO biosphere reserve, in close collaboration with local Indians. UNESCO has declared the Yasuni national park to be an international bioshpere reserve.
In 1987, deforestation caused 1.2 million tons of carbon to be released into the atmosphere. The burning of the forests releases huge amounts of carbon into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide gas.
In Tanzania, Zambia, Zaire and Sudan over 50% of their elephant population was killed in the 1980s. In the 1980s, four countries, Tanzania, Zambia, Zaire and Sudan, lost 750,000 elephants.
In Murchison Falls National Park, there were only 2,300 survivors from 14,000 elephants in the 1960s. In Tanzania, Zambia, Zaire and Sudan over 50% of their elephant population was killed in the 1980s. In the 1970s and 1980s, Kenya's elephant herd was cut from 65,000 to 17,000. Over 700,000 elephants were lost to poachers collecting tusks for the valuable ivory.
Rwanda was losing its gorilla population to poachers who seized infants to send to zoos while slaughtering the adults. In Rwanda, mountain gorillas are poached to steal infants for zoos, and for natives who collect the skulls.
In Rwanda, mountain gorillas are poached to steal infants for zoos, and for natives who collect the skulls. Gorilla skulls were sold to native collectors.
In China, poaching is one factor for the decreasing number of pandas. China's giant pandas and eastern Poland's bison are endangered. Asian victims include tigers, leopards, and other cats in India and giant pandas in China. Other animals which are poached include bison in Poland, giant pandas in China, and whales in the ocean.
Poaching is a concern in Poland regarding bison, but efforts are made to protect yet limit numbers of Europe's largest beast. In Poland, the bison are threatened and, in the United States, black bears and birds of prey (hawks, eagles and owls) are killed. Other animals which are poached include bison in Poland, giant pandas in China, and whales in the ocean. Poland faces some poaching of its rare bison population.
In the US, poachers endanger black bears for their gall bladders and birds of prey for their body parts (hawk talons, golden eagle feathers, great horned owl heads). Even in the US poaching is a problem, particularly of birds of prey whose talons and feathers are considered collectors items. In the western United States poachers have sought body parts of various raptors, including hawks and eagles. In Poland, the bison are threatened and, in the United States, black bears and birds of prey (hawks, eagles and owls) are killed.
In New England, authorities have broken-up a syndicate which poached black bears for their gallbladders which have medicinal value in the Far East. In the US, poachers endanger black bears for their gall bladders and birds of prey for their body parts (hawk talons, golden eagle feathers, great horned owl heads). In Northeastern US, more than 400 black bears were killed for their gall bladders which are prized as aphrodisiacs in the Far East.
Finally, in 1989, the evidence of abuse persuaded African and Western publics to back a ban on the ivory trade. In 1989, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) led by Kenya, banned the trade in ivory, and nine African nations are planning a regional task force to fight international crime syndicates dealing in ivory and rhino horns. The 1989 international trade ban on ivory cut down significantly on the loss of the elephant population. A major help in preventing poaching is the 1989 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, which banned trade in ivory.

In Africa where extensive anti-poaching programs are constantly applied, most of the poaching focuses on elephants and rhinos whose ivory tusks are smuggled out through various African countries. Over 700,000 elephants were lost to poachers collecting tusks for the valuable ivory. Countries where elephants are poached for their ivory tusks include Zambia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Elephants are valued for their ivory tusks and rhinos for their horns which China values for medicinal use.
An international task force was being formed in Africa. Law enforcement officers from nine African countries met to create a task force to fight international crime syndicates dealing in ivory, and rhino horns. African countries created a regional task force to fight trade in contraband. In 1989, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) led by Kenya, banned the trade in ivory, and nine African nations are planning a regional task force to fight international crime syndicates dealing in ivory and rhino horns.
Economic incentives include Zimbabwe's CAMPFIRE project which allows districts so many animal kills annually, encouraging protection of game quotas for high-profit safari hunting; and the South African-based Conservation Corporation which attracts development and investment funds and gets money circulated locally to show that conservation is in the people's interest. Zimbabwe's Communal Areas Management Program for Indigenous Resources links cash with conservation, enabling rural communities to make money from animals which had been poached as pests.
India instituted "Project Tiger" as a national campaign to save their cats in 1973. India has launched a national campaign called "Project Tiger" to protect these animals whose skins, along with leopards and other cats, are sought for fur. A national campaign, Project Tiger, has succeeded in protecting the tiger population, now on the increase. India instituted Project Tiger.
Arrested poachers are reformed in the Conservation Corps and turned into honorary gamekeepers. In both India and Africa, efforts have been made to make protection of wildlife an economic advantage to their human neighbors by hiring locals (even former poachers) as game wardens and guards.
Namibian police smashed a major international syndicate smuggling tusks. Poaching rings were broken in India, the US and Namibia.
Countries where rhinos are poached for their horns include Somalia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Kenya, and Swaziland. Elephants are valued for their ivory tusks and rhinos for their horns which China values for medicinal use.
In the US, Massachusetts' wildlife authorities have recently broken a poachers' ring that slaughtered some 400 black bears. In New England, authorities have broken-up a syndicate which poached black bears for their gallbladders which have medicinal value in the Far East. Poaching rings were broken in India, the US and Namibia.
Kenya's elaborate security network ensures tourists' safety and comfort, and it established a shoot-to-kill policy against poachers. It has responded with a shoot-to-kill policy against poachers and the creation of an elaborate security network, including aerial surveillance of its parks.
Kenya and Zimbabwe instituted shoot-to-kill policies toward poachers. It has responded with a shoot-to-kill policy against poachers and the creation of an elaborate security network, including aerial surveillance of its parks. Kenya's elaborate security network ensures tourists' safety and comfort, and it established a shoot-to-kill policy against poachers. In Africa, improved enforcement has included more wildlife agents and game wardens, using reconnaissance vehicles and airplanes, going after bandits, high fines, and a shoot-to-kill policy.

After establishing wildlife reserves and tough protective laws, there are four general steps to reducing poaching. To prevent poaching, wildlife is guarded in parks. Measurers taken to protect these species have included making safe havens for the animals, making ivory trade illegal, dehorning rhinos to decrease their value to poachers, jailing and even shooting poachers, providing economic incentives and promoting conservation.
They save time, energy, and money, undercutting integrated producers who transform iron ore into finished steel in many stages. The big steel companies employ manufacturing methods that require immense capital investment and many labor-intensive steps in production.
Japan was researching direct iron ore smelting, which would eliminate expensive separate coking ovens and sinterers. The Japanese are researching a method to replace the coking ovens and sinterers using one large blast furnace with two smaller furnaces attached.
They believe this method will cut costs by 10% and expected it to be operational by 2004. Commercial viability wasn't expected for ten years.
The new technology, called thin-slab casting, sharply cuts the time and capital costs required for steel sheet production, namely by melting scrap iron rather then pig iron, then casting the steel into two-inch slabs, and rolling them into coils, all in a single production run. They save time, energy, and money, undercutting integrated producers who transform iron ore into finished steel in many stages. Done in mini-mills the method takes less time, uses non-union labor and a lean organizational structure, and is less capital intensive. This sharply cuts time, labor, and energy costs.
The thin slab is then passed on rollers through a furnace to make the temperature across its width consistent. The resulting thin slab is passed on rollers through a furnace and then goes through rolling mills, emerging as coils of hot-rolled sheet steel.
The resulting thin slab is passed on rollers through a furnace and then goes through rolling mills, emerging as coils of hot-rolled sheet steel. It next goes to rolling mills to become coils of hot rolled sheet steel.
Mini-mills make steel by melting scrap metal in small electric arc furnaces, avoiding the expensive process of making pig iron and reducing the number of manufacturing steps. The new technology, called thin-slab casting, sharply cuts the time and capital costs required for steel sheet production, namely by melting scrap iron rather then pig iron, then casting the steel into two-inch slabs, and rolling them into coils, all in a single production run.

Mini-mills have lower capital demands and operating costs than traditional steel manufacturers. This process is called thin slab casting and is quicker and less capital intensive than the traditional ore to smelter process, and reduces the cost of producing a ton of steel. Done in mini-mills the method takes less time, uses non-union labor and a lean organizational structure, and is less capital intensive.
The main new technology in steel-making involves mini-mills developed by West Germany's SMS Schloemann-Siemag. The SMS Schloemann-Siemag process for producing steel was introduced in 1989. The technology, first developed by the SMS Schloemann-Siemag Company of West Germany in the mid-1980s, when combined with non-union labor and reduced manufacturing costs, is beginning to spread throughout the world. In the mid-1980s, the German company SMS Schloemann-Siemag developed a process to produce sheet steel in a single production run.
Nucor Company in Crawfordville, Indiana was the first to pioneer the new technology and became the only major steel company to show a profit in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Nucor, the leading US mini-mill group, has its main plant in Crawfordsville, Indiana and is developing another in Hickman, Arkansas.
U.S. mini-mills, Chapparal and Birmingham, also made profits through the recession of the early 1990s. Others who built mini-mills include Chapparal, Birmingham, Co-Steel, Trico Steel (LTV, British Steel, Sumitomo Metal Industries), a Broken Hill Proprietary/Cargill partnership, an Italian group, and Spain's Integrated Steel Corporation. The US companies currently using the new technology are Nucor, Chapparal, Birmingham and LTV's Trico Steel. Other mini-mill steel producers are Chapparal, Birmingham, an Italian mini-mill group, and Co-Steel, with mini-mills in Canada, the US and the UK.

Mini-mills also went up in Spain, South Africa, Italy, Germany and Holland.
It also has a joint venture in Hunterston, Scotland. Nucor was able to open another plant in Hickman, Arkansas and has been looking at cooperative ventures in Great Britain and Europe.
Product doesn't suffer traditional steel's cracks but had initial quality problems and still experiences some gummy scale. The main technical problem is quality control. Nucor had steel quality problems at start up which were easily solved. Technical problems that have arisen in the new technology include the need for a tighter process control parameters and the larger issue of a thin gummy scale that forms on some of the production process.
However, steel from mini-mills is of a grade more suitable for construction than for more demanding applications, such as car-body panels. Mini-mills produce lower-grade steel for niche markets like construction.
However, steel from mini-mills is of a grade more suitable for construction than for more demanding applications, such as car-body panels. For instance, the steel was not suitable for automobile exteriors.
Still another new technology is strip casting which US Steel may invest in and is expected to produce a superior quality of steel. Some other new technologies for steel production include using a hot rolling mill to produce thin strip casting, which US Steel believes produces a higher quality product, and using electric arc furnaces to replace the old coal-fired equipment.

A dozen masterpieces were taken from Boston's Gardner Museum, the biggest art theft in US history. Two robbers dressed as police officers steal 11 paintings and an ancient Chinese beaker from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.
Two portraits, brought to Sotheby's for evaluation by a man who bought them at a market, were recovered using the Art Loss Register database. Two portraits from London were recovered using the Loss Register when the paintings were brought to Southby's Auction House.
Centralized inventory records for museums aid in theft awareness. In addition to data bases and publicity, stolen art is recovered when someone seeks a appraisal or offers it for sale to dealers or auction houses, responds to a reward offer, attempts to move it through customs, or requests a ransom for the art.
The London-based International Art Loss Register (ALR), a computerized database containing descriptions and photographs of stolen artwork and linked with auction house catalogue information, has been highly successful. In Great Britain, the International Art Loss Registry founded by the leading auction houses (Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips) has a computerized data bases easily accessed by law enforcement authorities and insurance companies.
When photographs and documentation are available, identification of stolen artwork can be confirmed. Good photographic and other documentation uniquely describing the item and circumstances of its theft, are essential for the success of such registries in identifying possible stolen items.

Stealing art works has become the second biggest international criminal activity after narcotics. Stealing art works is the second biggest international criminal activity after narcotics. Theft of precious artwork by global criminals has become common, second only to narcotics theft.
Suspects were arrested in both cases. A Rubens painting stolen from a Spanish Museum was recovered in Florida and four Miami residents were arrested in connection with the theft.
In addition to data bases and publicity, stolen art is recovered when someone seeks a appraisal or offers it for sale to dealers or auction houses, responds to a reward offer, attempts to move it through customs, or requests a ransom for the art. Stolen art has been recovered when offered to police sting operations or to legitimate buyers or dealers, who detect that the offered art is stolen through catalogs of stolen items circulated among dealers, auction houses, museums and police or by their consulting the International Art Loss Register, to which any one, not just major art holders, can report thefts. It has been recognized and recovered when brought to auction houses or dealers for sale or evaluation. Auction houses often recognize artworks brought to them as stolen.
The art is frequently recovered but the thieves not found. Suspects are not always arrested. The arrest and prosecution of the culprits is even more rare than the recovery.
Documentation is essential to recovering a stolen work of art. Good photographic and other documentation uniquely describing the item and circumstances of its theft, are essential for the success of such registries in identifying possible stolen items. Documentation and photographs of artwork are essential for recovery.
Three Swedes were arrested in a Belgian police sting operation. A Belgian policeman posing as an art dealer arrested three Swedes trying to sell a stolen Picasso painting.
In France dealers must register all purchased art, except what is bought at auction. Also, French dealers are required to register all purchases. In France, art dealers are obliged by law to register all purchases except those bought at public auction. French law requires dealers to register purchases.
Customs has seized stolen artwork being taken abroad. In addition to data bases and publicity, stolen art is recovered when someone seeks a appraisal or offers it for sale to dealers or auction houses, responds to a reward offer, attempts to move it through customs, or requests a ransom for the art.
Ransom attempts expose thieves to capture. In addition to data bases and publicity, stolen art is recovered when someone seeks a appraisal or offers it for sale to dealers or auction houses, responds to a reward offer, attempts to move it through customs, or requests a ransom for the art. Ransoms asked by thieves have led to recovery.
Since then, hundreds of dogs have been trained and deployed throughout the U.S. and increasing numbers of other countries, including Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Mexico. City and county police agencies, customs departments, fire departments, the Secret Service, highway patrol, border patrol, military bases and some prisons in the US and many other countries use dogs to help in law enforcement work.
Dogs perform many different law-enforcement tasks around the world. City and county police agencies, customs departments, fire departments, the Secret Service, highway patrol, border patrol, military bases and some prisons in the US and many other countries use dogs to help in law enforcement work. Dogs are well-established partners in law enforcement. Dogs are increasingly being used in a variety of law-enforcement work.
City and county police agencies, customs departments, fire departments, the Secret Service, highway patrol, border patrol, military bases and some prisons in the US and many other countries use dogs to help in law enforcement work. U.S. Customs, Border Patrol, Postal Service, Secret Service, FBI and military police also use dogs for much the same kinds of tasks. Border guards us dogs to sniff narcotics, explosives, contraband, and even hiding or smuggled people, trying to illegally pass through borders. The tasks performed by dogs include searching passengers, vehicles, aircraft, ships and cargo for bombs, drugs and agricultural contraband at borders, ports, and airports, as well as at crime scenes or on regular patrol.
Dogs perform many different law-enforcement tasks around the world. Law enforcement agencies use dogs worldwide. Several dog breeds are used in law enforcement world-wide. City and county police agencies, customs departments, fire departments, the Secret Service, highway patrol, border patrol, military bases and some prisons in the US and many other countries use dogs to help in law enforcement work.
Specific US federal organizations using dogs include the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Secret Service, Customs Service, and Postal Service. Consequently, dogs are used by Customs officials at border crossings and by narcotics enforcement officers and by those charged with airport and airline safety. They are used by border patrol officers and customs officials to sniff out evidence of drugs aboard ships, airplanes, trains, trucks, and automobiles. City and county police agencies, customs departments, fire departments, the Secret Service, highway patrol, border patrol, military bases and some prisons in the US and many other countries use dogs to help in law enforcement work.
Dogs trained to sniff out narcotics are now considered a necessity in drug enforcement. Border guards us dogs to sniff narcotics, explosives, contraband, and even hiding or smuggled people, trying to illegally pass through borders. Although dogs have been used in police work for years, primarily for patrol duty, their use in detecting narcotics gained widespread acceptance only around 1980. A dog's keen sense of smell enables it to be trained to identify many types of narcotics, explosives, and flammable material.
The tasks performed by dogs include searching passengers, vehicles, aircraft, ships and cargo for bombs, drugs and agricultural contraband at borders, ports, and airports, as well as at crime scenes or on regular patrol. Dogs can often provide a short cut to finding dangerous or contraband items that would take humans, even with sensors, much longer time to find. Border guards us dogs to sniff narcotics, explosives, contraband, and even hiding or smuggled people, trying to illegally pass through borders.
Dogs are used for tracking a suspect, missing person or lost child. Working as a team with police dogs help hunt down and capture criminal suspects. Such dogs cannot only track the suspects but are trained to tackle them as well. They are excellent at tracking suspects and missing persons, and add muscle to law enforcement personnel in controlling crowds.
Dogs can also pick-up scent from a crime scene and track persons who were at that site. On patrol, police dogs track, control, apprehend, or attack suspects and are used to investigate crime scenes. They therefore are used to search anywhere they are needed, including crime scenes, fires, border crossings, vehicles, airplanes, airports, and boats. The tasks performed by dogs include searching passengers, vehicles, aircraft, ships and cargo for bombs, drugs and agricultural contraband at borders, ports, and airports, as well as at crime scenes or on regular patrol.
They also detect bombs, and find missing persons and criminals often in easily overlooked places. Police also use dogs to track and apprehend criminals and for crowd control. On patrol, police dogs track, control, apprehend, or attack suspects and are used to investigate crime scenes.
Dogs are taken on police patrols first to serve as a deterrent, then to search for suspects, chase suspects, and if necessary attack and hold a suspect to complete an arrest. Police also use dogs to track and apprehend criminals and for crowd control. On patrol, police dogs track, control, apprehend, or attack suspects and are used to investigate crime scenes. Working as a team with police dogs help hunt down and capture criminal suspects.
Besides patrolling and narcotics detection, dogs are used in many types of police work, including detection of explosives and flammable liquids, crowd control and manhunts. 20 The dogs serve several functions.
Vapor sniffing dogs are used by arson investigators to detect the presence of flammable liquids. Their extraordinary noses make them superior to any man or man-made device in detecting substances such as narcotics, explosives, flammable liquids, and agricultural contraband. Besides patrolling and narcotics detection, dogs are used in many types of police work, including detection of explosives and flammable liquids, crowd control and manhunts. Dogs are valued for their sense of smell and have been trained to detect narcotics, explosives, agricultural products, and flammable and volatile liquids.
Dogs are used for crowd control in such places as demonstrations, sporting events, and riots. They are also used for crowd control against rioters or unruly protesters.
They therefore are used to search anywhere they are needed, including crime scenes, fires, border crossings, vehicles, airplanes, airports, and boats. Dogs are used in airports for the same activities, inspecting airplanes, passengers and luggage. The tasks performed by dogs include searching passengers, vehicles, aircraft, ships and cargo for bombs, drugs and agricultural contraband at borders, ports, and airports, as well as at crime scenes or on regular patrol. They are used by border patrol officers and customs officials to sniff out evidence of drugs aboard ships, airplanes, trains, trucks, and automobiles.
London police use dogs to monitor potential IRA terrorist activity and to check vehicles at roadblocks for weapons, explosives, and suspects. So do police, border and security forces in Germany, Britain, Argentina, Greece, Czechoslovakia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Mexico, the Netherlands and Italy.
U.S. Customs, Border Patrol, Postal Service, Secret Service, FBI and military police also use dogs for much the same kinds of tasks. Specific US federal organizations using dogs include the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Secret Service, Customs Service, and Postal Service.

Many U.S. city, county, state and federal police, fire and correctional departments use dogs for the above mentioned tasks. These include police departments, highway patrols, fire departments, sheriff departments, and airport security. State and local police officials use drug-sniffing dogs in narcotic searches.
They therefore are used to search anywhere they are needed, including crime scenes, fires, border crossings, vehicles, airplanes, airports, and boats. The tasks performed by dogs include searching passengers, vehicles, aircraft, ships and cargo for bombs, drugs and agricultural contraband at borders, ports, and airports, as well as at crime scenes or on regular patrol.
One prison uses dogs in the prison to patrol with the guards and to track any escapees. City and county police agencies, customs departments, fire departments, the Secret Service, highway patrol, border patrol, military bases and some prisons in the US and many other countries use dogs to help in law enforcement work. Prison officials use guard dogs and tracker dogs for patrols and to search for escaped prisoners. Prison guards use German shepherds for crowd control and to track escaped convicts.
Dogs augment control of protestors and prisoners. Prison guards use German shepherds for crowd control and to track escaped convicts.
Other breeds which assist law enforcement include Airedale-Belgian malinois mixes, Rottweilers, beagles, English cocker spaniels, beagle-spaniel mixes, and mongrels. Other dogs used in police work are: Alsatians, Rottweilers, English Cocker Spaniels, and various mixes of pit bulls and beagles. The most common are German shepherds, Labrador retrievers and Belgian malinois, but Airedale-Belgian malinois mixes, pit-bulls, Rottweilers, Alsatians, cocker spaniels, beagles and beagle-spaniel mixes are also used. German shepherds, Belgian malinois, rottweilers, and Labradors are popular, as are mixed large breeds such a pit bull mix and an Airedale-Belgian malinois mix.

On the milder side, in the interest of public relations in the US, K-9 officers will demonstrate police dog skills for students in public schools. When not on patrol, many police dogs perform public relations duties in schools, senior citizen homes and hospitals.
Most organizations prefer larger dogs. Large dogs are preferred because they provide a more imposing presence but small dogs also have a strong sense of smell and are therefore useful, especially if access to a small, confined area is required.
A dog's keen sense of smell enables it to be trained to identify many types of narcotics, explosives, and flammable material. Dogs have a keen ability to distinguish among hundreds of odors. They can immediately detect trace quantities of as many as 17 different flammable, volatile liquids used in arson, in concentrations measured in parts per billion. Dogs are valued for their sense of smell and have been trained to detect narcotics, explosives, agricultural products, and flammable and volatile liquids.
They assist in searching for missing persons. Dogs are used for tracking a suspect, missing person or lost child. Dogs are used to search for missing persons, including lost children. They also detect bombs, and find missing persons and criminals often in easily overlooked places.
Airport security officers use drug-sniffing dogs to detect drugs in bags, suitcases, parcels, or on passengers. The tasks performed by dogs include searching passengers, vehicles, aircraft, ships and cargo for bombs, drugs and agricultural contraband at borders, ports, and airports, as well as at crime scenes or on regular patrol. Dogs are used in airports for the same activities, inspecting airplanes, passengers and luggage.
Robots helped to carry out hip replacements, prostate operations and brain surgery. Robotic assistants are used in surgery helping with hip replacements, prostate operations, and even brain surgery.
Also in 1994, news came of an automated packaging and palletizing line for packaged foods in use by the French army. Robots change computer tapes; staff a library; and handle, pack and palletize food ration boxes. The police use robots for bomb detection and the military use them for packing and delivering rations. The French army uses robots to package and palletize ration boxes for troops.
They retrieve and reshelf library books and computer tapes. Robots change computer tapes; staff a library; and handle, pack and palletize food ration boxes. Corporate IT departments use robots for loading and unloading memory tapes.
Police use robots with the bomb squad and even during terrorist or hostage situations. Police bomb squads use robots to approach suspicious packages to determine if they contain explosives. The police use robots for bomb detection and the military use them for packing and delivering rations. Police use robots for bomb-handling and other tasks.
Robots entertain at children's' parties and amusement parks, and as mannequins in stores, and malls. Portable robots are used for retail display, party games for children, and museum-robotics shows. Robots now are available for children's parties, are being offered as mannequins for department stores and advertising, and are wax singers in the Rock Hall of Fame.
Increased uses of robotics in vehicle manufacturing include automatic-arc welding, welding tank turrets, painting, water-jet cutting, final body assembly, and engine assembly using smaller editions. Smaller robots are increasingly being used in automobile engine assembly. In the automotive industry, new robotics applications include engine assembly, final assembly work, and paint spraying. Robots are used in precision design, machining, and assembly of vehicles, aircraft, and engines, machine tools and computers.
The rise of robots focused initially on the automobile industry but its applications are expanding into new markets such as health care, precision engineering, food industry, materials handling and packaging. In the medical profession, there is a robotic system for producing cloned cells for genetics research, another for assisting surgeons in a wide range of surgeries, and a robotic arm with a contoured spoon has been developed for the disabled who are unable to feed themselves. The medical field uses robots for several purposes. Robotics assists doctors in the medical operating theater.

In the medical profession, there is a robotic system for producing cloned cells for genetics research, another for assisting surgeons in a wide range of surgeries, and a robotic arm with a contoured spoon has been developed for the disabled who are unable to feed themselves. The London-based charity, Imperial Cancer Research Fund developed a robotic system to help scientists produce the huge numbers of cloned cells required for genetics research. In 1994, a British group developed a robotic system that helps scientists produce the huge numbers of cloned cells required for genetic research.
A machine tool plant became one large machine to make machines. The Fanuc factory of Japan, a manufacturer of machine tools, has robots making other robots. Robots are even making robots. Robots are used in precision design, machining, and assembly of vehicles, aircraft, and engines, machine tools and computers.
In the medical profession, there is a robotic system for producing cloned cells for genetics research, another for assisting surgeons in a wide range of surgeries, and a robotic arm with a contoured spoon has been developed for the disabled who are unable to feed themselves. Severely disabled persons eat more comfortably when fed by a robotic spoon.
They harvest agricultural crops using highly skilled operations, finding and delicately tapping 2,000 rubber trees a day. Plantation owners in Malaysia are using robots to collect latex from rubber trees, ordinarily a labor-intensive process. In Malaysia robots are taking over the tasks of traditional rubber tappers. Rubber plantations are using them to tap the trees and collect the rubber.
Robots are also finding their way into the operating room for laparoscopic surgery with the Laparobot and brain surgery with the Neurobot. Robots helped to carry out hip replacements, prostate operations and brain surgery. Many surgical uses for robots are now in place. They assist surgeons in delicate operations on hips and hernias, bones and brains.
Other newer industrial uses include glass making and abrading denim jeans. Robots spray metallic paint on Apple Macintosh computer parts, and spray dye on denim for a "pre-worn" look. Robotic laser cutting, water jet cutting, automated arc welding, and jean-sprayers for clothing manufactures are being tested. The fashion industry is using robots to uniformly spray patterns on fabric.
Lasar-cutting and water-jet precision cutting is being done by robots to cut carpets, door panels, and instrument panels. Dangerous robotic tasks include machining and assembly of weapons; laser and water jet cutting of materials from cloth to metals; automated warehouse stocking and product shipping; shipping container unloading, stacking and reloading between ships and trucks; nuclear fuel handling; space shuttle robotic arm capture and deployment of satellites; and inspecting and handling bombs or suspicious items. Increased uses of robotics in vehicle manufacturing include automatic-arc welding, welding tank turrets, painting, water-jet cutting, final body assembly, and engine assembly using smaller editions. Robotic laser cutting, water jet cutting, automated arc welding, and jean-sprayers for clothing manufactures are being tested.
In 1993 there were several new applications: A Swedish auto manufacturer used a robotized system that cuts, cleans, washes and dries vehicle instrument panels, the first time all four operations were carried out by one machine. Lasar-cutting and water-jet precision cutting is being done by robots to cut carpets, door panels, and instrument panels.
Robots are used to manage, stack, and store inventory items at Fiat, the Cal State Northridge library, and Yamazaki machine tool warehouse. Inventory management uses computer controlled robots to retrieve randomly stored items; this same technology was used to make a fully automated library: Leviathan II in California. They retrieve and reshelf library books and computer tapes. Robots change computer tapes; staff a library; and handle, pack and palletize food ration boxes.
That is double the present 5.5 billion. By the year 2050, the world population is expected to double from 5.7 bn to some 10.6 bn. Population Fund report projects that by 2050 the world population will have grown from 1994's 5.7 billion to stabilize at 10 billion (if population growth rates continue to decline as expected), 7.8 billion (if rates decline even just a little faster than expected) or 12.5 billion (if today's rates stop falling). United Nations population projections in 1993 were for the world population to double from the current 5.5 billion to 11 billion by 2050.
United Nations population projections in 1993 were for the world population to double from the current 5.5 billion to 11 billion by 2050. Assuming the birthrate continues its present fall, the population of the world is expected to be 10 billion before it stabilizes in 2050. By UN projections, the world population will reach over 10 billion in 2050 before it stabilizes.

Factors influencing growth rate are that women have more educational opportunity, access to family planning and methods of contraception. Yet, the serious economic disadvantages to nations and individuals of over-population have driven Islamic Iran, Egypt, Albania, Tunisia (which abolished polygamy), and largely Catholic Spain, Italy, Mexico, Brazil and other Latin American countries to remove government subsidies encouraging large families, start family planning (particularly contraception); women's health and education; and women's emancipation and employment efforts, to reduce fertility rates, as have the U.K., Germany, India, China, Mauritius, the Philippines, Zimbabwe and Botswana. Wherever governments have encouraged family planning, birth rates have dropped. The major factors affecting lower growth rates around the world are: increased literacy rights granted to women, family planning programs, and higher employment.
The successful lowering of birth rates in countries such as China, India, Iran, Tunisia, Egypt, and Brazil are worth noting. A government program and contraception access is starting to slow Iran's rate. Iran's clerics, who initially encouraged large families, now encourage family planning, which has dropped their growth rate from 3.9% to 2.3%. Moslem countries such as Indonesia, Iran, Egypt and especially, Tunisia have slowed birth rates.
Birth rates in Latin American countries have fallen dramatically, with growth rates under 2%. A sharp slowdown has also occurred in Brazil and other Latin American countries. Nearly 95% of the projected rise would come from developing countries, despite successes that many Asian and Latin American countries have had in bringing down their birth rates.
Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest fertility rates, averaging more than 6 children per woman. Population continues to grow in sub-Saharan Africa, where few use contraception and six children are born per woman. Sub-Saharan Africa has fertility rates over 6 per woman.
Nearly 95 percent of the projected rise will come from developing countries. Nearly 95% of the projected rise would come from developing countries, despite successes that many Asian and Latin American countries have had in bringing down their birth rates.
Countries which have seen birth rates decline include Egypt, China, India, Tunisia, and Brazil. The emancipation of women, along with state-controlled family programs and the increasing use of contraceptives in Tunisia and Egypt, has cut the population growth rate in those countries nearly in half. The successful lowering of birth rates in countries such as China, India, Iran, Tunisia, Egypt, and Brazil are worth noting. Moslem countries such as Indonesia, Iran, Egypt and especially, Tunisia have slowed birth rates.
Countries which have seen birth rates decline include Egypt, China, India, Tunisia, and Brazil. The birth rate has declined from 45 to 24.4 per 1,000. The successful lowering of birth rates in countries such as China, India, Iran, Tunisia, Egypt, and Brazil are worth noting. Women being educated, working, and using contraception have slowed Tunisia's rate, while Singapore's dropped too sharply for the government.
In Brazil, the female fertility rate began a fall from 5.8 in 1970 to 2.3 percent in 1994. Catholic countries with large populations and high birth rates such as Brazil, Mexico, and the Philippines are beginning to see slowing in birth rates. The successful lowering of birth rates in countries such as China, India, Iran, Tunisia, Egypt, and Brazil are worth noting. Countries which have seen birth rates decline include Egypt, China, India, Tunisia, and Brazil.
Although a Catholic country, Mexico is trying to limit growth and 48% of the women use contraception. The Mexican government is battling huge population growth in a strongly Catholic country.
The emancipation of women, along with state-controlled family programs and the increasing use of contraceptives in Tunisia and Egypt, has cut the population growth rate in those countries nearly in half. Women being educated, working, and using contraception have slowed Tunisia's rate, while Singapore's dropped too sharply for the government. In Tunisia, for example, government efforts to educate women and bring them into the workforce helped lower birth rates to 1.9 % per woman.
In all of these countries success was achieved through education about family planning and availability of contraceptive devises. Yet, the serious economic disadvantages to nations and individuals of over-population have driven Islamic Iran, Egypt, Albania, Tunisia (which abolished polygamy), and largely Catholic Spain, Italy, Mexico, Brazil and other Latin American countries to remove government subsidies encouraging large families, start family planning (particularly contraception); women's health and education; and women's emancipation and employment efforts, to reduce fertility rates, as have the U.K., Germany, India, China, Mauritius, the Philippines, Zimbabwe and Botswana. Factors influencing growth rate are that women have more educational opportunity, access to family planning and methods of contraception. The fertility rate in Brazil has dropped because of urbanization and contraception.
The policy has had a dramatic effect, with the fertility rate falling to around 1.9 from 2.25 by 1994. China has a strict birth control policy but it is not effective in the countryside. China's "one child" policy has kept population growth down to the same 1.9% as in western Europe. In the early 1970s, a successful but controversial population control program was enacted in China.
Yet, the serious economic disadvantages to nations and individuals of over-population have driven Islamic Iran, Egypt, Albania, Tunisia (which abolished polygamy), and largely Catholic Spain, Italy, Mexico, Brazil and other Latin American countries to remove government subsidies encouraging large families, start family planning (particularly contraception); women's health and education; and women's emancipation and employment efforts, to reduce fertility rates, as have the U.K., Germany, India, China, Mauritius, the Philippines, Zimbabwe and Botswana. The program succeeded in lowering the growth rate from 2.4 percent to 2.1 percent in the first half of 1994. Catholic countries with large populations and high birth rates such as Brazil, Mexico, and the Philippines are beginning to see slowing in birth rates.

Economics, religion, and women's education are major factors that influence population growth or decline.
Economics, religion, and women's education are major factors that influence population growth or decline. Some belief systems significantly influence global population rate increases, especially in traditional Catholic and Islamic countries, which favor large families and discourage women's reproductive rights.
The emancipation of women, along with state-controlled family programs and the increasing use of contraceptives in Tunisia and Egypt, has cut the population growth rate in those countries nearly in half. Women being educated, working, and using contraception have slowed Tunisia's rate, while Singapore's dropped too sharply for the government. By 1986, 66 percent of women of child-bearing age were using contraception.
A government program and contraception access is starting to slow Iran's rate. The fertility rate in Iran has dropped significantly due to a government program for population control.
By 1994, the birthrate plummeted in eastern Germany and the former Soviet Union because of insecurity and the end of Communist subsidies to families. The growth rate in American is about 1 percent a year, 0.5 percent in Russia, and 0.3 percent in Western Europe. In the coming years, industrialized countries can expect slow growth at a rate of 1% in North America,.5% in the former Soviet Union, and .3% in Europe.
A sharp slowdown has also occurred in Brazil and other Latin American countries. Iran's clerics, who initially encouraged large families, now encourage family planning, which has dropped their growth rate from 3.9% to 2.3%. In Brazil, the female fertility rate began a fall from 5.8 in 1970 to 2.3 percent in 1994.

Birth rates in Latin American countries have fallen dramatically, with growth rates under 2%. A sharp slowdown has also occurred in Brazil and other Latin American countries.
The lessening demand for tin has resulted in many changes in Southeast Asian countries, especially in Malaysia. Tin mining in south-east Asia has been steadily declining because of rising production costs and record low tin prices.
Prices for tin fell dramatically and tin mining operations, particularly those involved in high cost hard rock mining, were forced to close down or cut back operation. Factors leading to tin mining decline include: depleted high-grade tin reserves and high production costs outside Indonesia, Vietnam, China, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, and Portugal; labor shortages and rising wages; Russia becoming a net tin exporter; tin market arbitrage; a strong Malaysian currency against the U.S. dollar; glass, aluminum and plastic packaging; thinner tin coatings on steel cans; and decreased tin-lead solder use. Tin mining in south-east Asia has been steadily declining because of rising production costs and record low tin prices.
Also glass, aluminum, and plastic began replacing tin as containers and the tin coating on tin-plated steel cans became thinner. Furthermore, the demand for tin for use in food storage was being replaced by glass, aluminum, and plastic. Factors leading to tin mining decline include: depleted high-grade tin reserves and high production costs outside Indonesia, Vietnam, China, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, and Portugal; labor shortages and rising wages; Russia becoming a net tin exporter; tin market arbitrage; a strong Malaysian currency against the U.S. dollar; glass, aluminum and plastic packaging; thinner tin coatings on steel cans; and decreased tin-lead solder use. Prices are also declining because materials like glass, aluminum, and plastic are replacing tin in the packaging industry.
In 1993, Malaysia Mining Corporation, one of the world's biggest producers, closed its tin mines. Gopeng, Malaysia's largest hydraulic tin mining operation closed in 1992, as did the Sungei Lembing mines and the Malaysia Mining Corp. in 1993.
Tin mining had been going on in Malaysia for centuries. Tin mining was a centuries old tradition in the country. Tin is part of the country's history: In the 19th century, hundreds of thousands of immigrants from China originally came to the country to work the tin mines.
For example, 50,000 tons of tin were produced in Malay in 1900. By 1900, it was producing 50,000 tons annually, over half the world's output.
In the 1960s, Malaysia was producing between 60,000 and 70,000 tons of tin annually and employing over 200,000 workers in the industry. After World War II, when the Japanese closed and flooded some mines, production resumed with Malaysian production in 1960 between 60,000 and 70,000 tons.
In spite of the huge drop in demand, CEOs of tin mines remain cautiously optimistic looking toward new uses for tin in plating car components, fire-retardant packaging, solders, lead-free tin alloy for gunshot, and tin bottle capsules. Future optimistic factors include: the International Tin Research Institute forecasting a 20% tin demand increase from new tin-zinc car plating alloys; new tin compounds for fire retardants, gunshot, solders, capsules; and a cheaper tin-steel "Ultimate Can".
The British initially developed the industry, employing hundreds of thousands of Chinese immigrants. The British began mining tin in the late 19th century in what is now Malaysia. In 1857 rich deposits were found on the Malay Peninsula and the industry flourished with British concessions and thousands of Chinese immigrant workers.
By the early 1980s, Malaysia was producing 60,000 tons of tin in concentrate per year while earning between M Dollars 32 and M Dollars 34 kilogram for tin exports. In the mid-1980s 40,000 workers produced 60,000 tons of tin in Malaysia. In the early 1980s, Malaysia was producing more than 60,000 tons of tin a year.
Factors leading to tin mining decline include: depleted high-grade tin reserves and high production costs outside Indonesia, Vietnam, China, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, and Portugal; labor shortages and rising wages; Russia becoming a net tin exporter; tin market arbitrage; a strong Malaysian currency against the U.S. dollar; glass, aluminum and plastic packaging; thinner tin coatings on steel cans; and decreased tin-lead solder use. The uses of tin have also been declining: aluminum now has the biggest share of the market for beverage cans and the use of tin in solders has been buoyant.
Several factors explain the slump: the 1985 buffer stock operations collapse leaving 100,000 tons of stockpiled tin on the market; China's export emergence and the Soviet Union's absence from the import market; the US Defense Logistics Agency's selling of tin from stockpiles and the increasing use of aluminum. Beginning in 1985 too much tin had been stockpiled in many countries in the world and was released on the market. Tin producers suffered a worldwide crisis in 1985. In 1985 the International Tin Council stopped price supports and dumped 100,000 tons of tin, crushing prices.
By 1993 China and Brazil were major tin producers and, as non-members of the ATCP, were stockpiling and exporting vast amounts of tin, driving the price down. The failure of the ATPC to enforce production quotas, increased production by non- ATPC members such as China and Brazil as well as the entry of new producers Peru, Portugal, and Vietnam, and the US Defense Logistics Agency disposing of large amounts of tin, all served to undermine the tin industry in Southeast Asia. But Brazil and China were not members.
Vietnam had entered the tin market, but Portugal and Peru were also exporters. The failure of the ATPC to enforce production quotas, increased production by non- ATPC members such as China and Brazil as well as the entry of new producers Peru, Portugal, and Vietnam, and the US Defense Logistics Agency disposing of large amounts of tin, all served to undermine the tin industry in Southeast Asia. Vietnam and Laos also became tin producers. Vietnam and Laos are also exporting tin.

The Soviet-bloc had been a big importer. The collapse of the former Soviet Union, once a substantial consumer of tin, added to the producers' difficulties.
By 1994, Malaysia was no longer a major producer. In the early 1990s, the Malaysia tin industry began a sharp decline -- down to M Dollars 12 kilogram.
In Southeast Asia, Indonesia is staging an attempt to ensure survival of domestic tin mining. Indonesia, the third largest tin producer, is attempting to maintain its domestic tin mining.
By 1993 China and Brazil were major tin producers and, as non-members of the ATCP, were stockpiling and exporting vast amounts of tin, driving the price down.

China and Brazil have increased tin exports, frustrating attempts to reduce global stockpiles.
During this same period, three countries that had lower labor costs, China, Indonesia, and Brazil raised output of tin to become bigger producers than Malaysia. China and Brazil have increased tin exports, frustrating attempts to reduce global stockpiles.

That year, 100,000 tons of stockpiled tin were released onto the market.
Tin prices dropped sharply when the International Tin Council's buffer stock operations collapsed, leaving 100,000 tons of tin stocks overhanging the market. Several factors explain the slump: the 1985 buffer stock operations collapse leaving 100,000 tons of stockpiled tin on the market; China's export emergence and the Soviet Union's absence from the import market; the US Defense Logistics Agency's selling of tin from stockpiles and the increasing use of aluminum. In 1985 the International Tin Council stopped price supports and dumped 100,000 tons of tin, crushing prices. That year, 100,000 tons of stockpiled tin were released onto the market.
Prices began dropping soon thereafter and efforts by the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) to limit production to boost prices were unsuccessful. Tin export quotas failed. Quotas on tin exports introduced by the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) did not have much effect on pricing. The failure of the ATPC to enforce production quotas, increased production by non- ATPC members such as China and Brazil as well as the entry of new producers Peru, Portugal, and Vietnam, and the US Defense Logistics Agency disposing of large amounts of tin, all served to undermine the tin industry in Southeast Asia.
In the late 1800's, Chinese immigrants flooded in to work the mines. The British began mining tin in the late 19th century in what is now Malaysia. Tin is part of the country's history: In the 19th century, hundreds of thousands of immigrants from China originally came to the country to work the tin mines.
In 1993 more Malaysian mines closed when government disincentives replaced subsidies. The Malaysian government, concluding that tin was no longer strategically important, decided to no longer subsidize mining development.
Historic Southeast Asian tin producers (Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand) were members of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC), which kept prices supported until 1985 when turmoil struck the industry. The ATPC linked Australia, Bolivia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand and Zaire.
Factors leading to tin mining decline include: depleted high-grade tin reserves and high production costs outside Indonesia, Vietnam, China, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, and Portugal; labor shortages and rising wages; Russia becoming a net tin exporter; tin market arbitrage; a strong Malaysian currency against the U.S. dollar; glass, aluminum and plastic packaging; thinner tin coatings on steel cans; and decreased tin-lead solder use. During this same period, three countries that had lower labor costs, China, Indonesia, and Brazil raised output of tin to become bigger producers than Malaysia. Low cost mines in Indonesia, Brazil, and China outsold Malaysia, raising surpluses and lowering prices.
It was originally developed by Cornish tin miners 100 years ago. The world's most extensively developed underground tin mine, stretching over 4,000 acres, was developed by Cornish miners 100 years ago at Sungei Lembing.

From before 1992 through 1994 the UK's Tory Prime Minister adamantly resisted calls by MPs of the miniscule Wales Nationalist Party (Plaid Cymru) for devolution of British rule to a fully self-governing Wales within the European Community. Those who speak the language support Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party whose policy is to bypass an assembly and go for an independent Wales within the European community. Conservatives were strongly opposed, and the policy of Plaid Cymru, the nationalist party, was to bypass an assembly and go directly for independence within the European community. Plaid Cymru wants full independence with a Welsh parliament.
Implementation of the local government reform will take place in April 1995. It intended that these councils should take over in April 1995. Plans were to create shadow councils for Wales and have them operational by the spring of 1995.
Proposals for the governing of Wales split more along party lines than national divisions. Support for the devolution of Wales generally followed party lines.
Those who speak the language support Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party whose policy is to bypass an assembly and go for an independent Wales within the European community. These divisions fall mainly along language lines with Welsh speakers favoring separation and English speakers preferring to keep the economic benefits of being part of Great Britain.
Within the first year of a Labor government devolution would be expected and a Welsh assembly granted. The Labor party, however, anxious for Plaid Cymru support, has promised to set up a Welsh assembly within its first year of government. A Labour conference promised a Welsh assembly within the first year of a Labour government. With only three members in parliament, they seek support from Labour who has promised an independent Welsh Assembly.
In Britain the Tories are in favor of keeping the existing relationship with Wales, perhaps with some internal restructuring of Welsh local government into districts. Prime Minister John Major and the Tories are against the establishment of a Welsh parliament, which has eroded the usual support conservative legislators had received in Wales.
Conservatives were strongly opposed, and the policy of Plaid Cymru, the nationalist party, was to bypass an assembly and go directly for independence within the European community. Those who speak the language support Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party whose policy is to bypass an assembly and go for an independent Wales within the European community. Plaid Cymru, the nationalist party of Wales, called for a Welsh parliament and wanted full self-government for Wales within the European Community. At that time, the Welsh Nationalist Party, Plaid Cymru, launched its manifesto urging self-government for Wales within the European Community (EU) noting that it was not just a distant aim but an urgent necessity and essential for democracy.
The government intends to set up 21 new authorities to replace the eight counties and 37 districts in Wales. The government does plan to restructure local government in Wales in which eight county and 37 district councils would be replaced by 21 unitary authorities. White papers recommended government reforms, which replaced the eight county councils and 37 district councils with 21 unitary authorities.
Concurrently, a white paper restructuring Welsh government into unitary districts, written by the British appointed Secretary of Wales, an English constituency Tory opposed to Welsh self-rule, was rejected by the Welsh Counties but supported by the underlying Districts. White papers recommended government reforms, which replaced the eight county councils and 37 district councils with 21 unitary authorities.
The government does plan to restructure local government in Wales in which eight county and 37 district councils would be replaced by 21 unitary authorities. White papers recommended government reforms, which replaced the eight county councils and 37 district councils with 21 unitary authorities. Many say that formation of assemblies would only create an expensive restructuring of current local services, (eight counties would be changed into 37 district councils,) and actually threaten local democracy. The government intends to set up 21 new authorities to replace the eight counties and 37 districts in Wales.
In 1992 Conservatives called the present arrangement the best for the UK and even the Welch minister, Alun Michael, did not consider devolution an issue. The Conservative led government in the United Kingdom in the early 1990s argued that the people of Wales "realized" that the best interest of their country and of the UK was to sustain the present arrangements.
Within the first year of a Labor government devolution would be expected and a Welsh assembly granted. Labour MP candidates committed to create a Welsh "assembly", not self-government, with representation to the EC's soon-to-be-formed Committee of the Regions, "within the life-time" of a prospective Labour-formed UK government, as well as assemblies for the English regions, and a Scottish Parliament with taxing powers. A Labour conference promised a Welsh assembly within the first year of a Labour government. The Labor party, however, anxious for Plaid Cymru support, has promised to set up a Welsh assembly within its first year of government.
Tony Blair, the Labor party leader, planned to pursue his intentions to set up a Welsh assembly. In December 1994, Tony Blair, Labour leader, and probable prime minister after an upcoming election, signaled a constitutional battle with the Tories by setting out proposals for devolution for Scotland and Wales. Labour has committed to the creation of a Welsh assembly, and party leader Tony Blair set out proposals for devolution, setting off a constitutional battle with the Tories.
From before 1992 through 1994 the UK's Tory Prime Minister adamantly resisted calls by MPs of the miniscule Wales Nationalist Party (Plaid Cymru) for devolution of British rule to a fully self-governing Wales within the European Community. In 1992, the British prime minister, John Major, rejected a call for a Welsh parliament with devolved powers by a Welsh member of parliament.
He reminded them that on an earlier occasion when there appeared to be a majority in favor of devolution, a referendum had produced a contrary result. Major reminded him that results of an earlier referendum, in 1978, showed that only 18 percent of Welsh voters favored a parliament.

In the 1979 referendum on devolution, the vote was four to one against an assembly. Plaid had only four MPs from 38 Welsh districts, who opposed self-rule in a 1979 referendum four-to-one.

In 1993 these plans were delayed for one year with shadow council elections scheduled for 1995 and in place in 1996. Implementation was postponed until at least 1995.
Alternately, some people believe that camaraderie among boys might disappear as soon as they begin competing for attention of new classmates. A minor concern would be that the camaraderie boys enjoy in singe-sex schools would be lost in coed schools, once they begin competing for the attentions of female classmates.
Women in single-sex colleges are more likely to graduate and obtain advanced degrees than those attending coed schools. Women at single-sex colleges are more likely to graduate and obtain advanced degrees than women at co-ed schools. The women are more likely to graduate and obtain advanced degrees.
Single-sex education appears to have definite advantages for girls. Single-sex education is superior for girls. There is statistically significant evidence that girls do benefit more from single-sex schools than coeducational. Even though research shows that single-sex education is beneficial for girls, the few women's colleges in the U.S. are struggling.
A minor concern would be that the camaraderie boys enjoy in singe-sex schools would be lost in coed schools, once they begin competing for the attentions of female classmates. Both girls and boys can forge close friendships and camaraderie in single sex institutions.
A1993 survey revealed the same pattern in the state sector: Of the top 30 state schools, 25 were single-sex. Ratings of schools by the Financial Times of London consistently show that single-sex schools rate higher academically. In 1992-1994, UK testing of school performance showed that "a disproportionate share of the best schools, academically, are single-sex," both public and private (sectarian or secular). Britain does a rating and ranking of both public and private schools annually.
Many supporters of co-ed schools do so because it is more like the real world environment where both sexes mingle. Another advantage is that students get accustomed to working with the other gender, a more natural situation and one that will be experienced in the workforce.
They went co-ed, merged with men's schools or closed. From1960 to 1990, the number of women's colleges dropped from 298 to 94.
In the United Kingdom single-sex schools are the ones performing better academically with only one school in the top 30 being coeducational before the age of 16. Generally speaking, single-sex schools have tended to produce higher levels of academic achievement. In 1992-1994, UK testing of school performance showed that "a disproportionate share of the best schools, academically, are single-sex," both public and private (sectarian or secular). Ratings of schools by the Financial Times of London consistently show that single-sex schools rate higher academically.
It is argued that separation of the sexes allows for less distraction in the classroom. Educators believe that girls flourish in classrooms without boys, who tend to be less mature, and benefit from having fewer distractions. They are able to study without intimidation and with fewer distractions.
Most parents dislike segregation by sex; seeing it as a barrier to successful socialization of adolescents. Many parents dislike sex segregation and many students prefer coeducation.
Same-sex schools are inherently selective of the highest performing students. One socioeconomic factor factoring private, single-sex schools is that they can be more selective than coeducational schools in recruiting students and are able to defend their character against internal attempts by bureaucrats and politicians to reform them.
The women are more likely to graduate and obtain advanced degrees. Women at single-sex colleges are more likely to graduate and obtain advanced degrees than women at co-ed schools. Women in single-sex colleges are more likely to graduate and obtain advanced degrees than those attending coed schools.

The dominant Slovak political party under demagogic Vladimir Meciar called for greater autonomy consistent with Slovakia's increasingly sense of nationalism. Czechoslovakia's split up was the result of growing deep-rooted Slovak nationalism following the collapse of the Soviet bloc. When the Soviet yoke lifted from Czechoslovakia, historic nationalistic feelings arose again.
Elections, in which Havel failed to be reelected president, brought to power Czech Prime Minister Klaus and Slovak Prime Minister Meciar. President Vaclav Havel was not reelected on July 6. His party pushed for greater economic and political autonomy for Slovakia and prevented the re-election of Vaclav Havel. By 1992, the polarization of politics between nationalists in Slovakia and market reformers in the Czech lands, as well as the defeat of Vaclav Havel, a strong advocate for the union, had put the federation of Czechs and Slovaks at risk.
He turned down the looser federation proposed by Vladimir Meciar, the Slovak leader. The Czechs voted for rapid market reforms and integration into Europe under the leadership of Vaclav Klaus and the Slovaks voted for the party of Vladimir Meciar and its avowedly separatist agenda. In the election of 1992, the Slovak nationalist Movement for a Democratic Slovakia led by charismatic Vladamir Meciar, won a large percentage of the vote. Elections, in which Havel failed to be reelected president, brought to power Czech Prime Minister Klaus and Slovak Prime Minister Meciar.
A new interim federal government was authorized to prepare for the smooth functioning of two sovereign states. The two parliaments passed a joint resolution authorizing an interim government leading to separation on January 1, 1993, which the Czechoslovak parliament endorsed. In early June 1992, the two leaders agreed to form an interim federal government, with equal representation for Slovaks and Czechs to oversee the separation of the state. The two agreed to form an interim federal government, equally Czech and Slovak, to oversee the dissolution of Czechoslovakia and an orderly transition of federal powers to both Czech and Slovak national parliaments.

In November 1992, the Czechoslovakian assembly passed a law authorizing the constitutional dissolution of the federal state. Compromises for political federation failed and it was agreed that the two parts of the country would "divorce".
A year after independence, Slovakia's economy was deeply in recession, and political infighting threatened to bring down the government. At the end of its first year of independence its economy was in recession with inflation and unemployment at high levels. One year later, Slovakia's economy remains deeply in recession, with inflation over 25% and unemployment on the rise. After one year, Slovakia was in deep recession.
Unemployment was high, foreign investments low, and inflation above 25%. At the end of its first year of independence its economy was in recession with inflation and unemployment at high levels.

Since the breakup, Slovakia has faced economic stress, higher unemployment, and some political upheaval since many of its citizens were not in favor of complete independence. Political infighting threatens the government and there is growing disillusionment with their confrontational prime minister. A year after independence, Slovakia's economy was deeply in recession, and political infighting threatened to bring down the government.
Slovakia had a concentration of uneconomic heavy industries geared to the Soviet market. Slovakia still had stronge ties to the East, it's factories producing heavy goods geared to Soviet markets. Slovakia's heavy industries were uneconomically geared to the Soviet market and it has yet to recover.
The Czech Republic, having been more industrialized, needs to restructure and develop its infrastructure, but is now free to pursue its own accelerated drive toward a free market society. The Czechs, representing 2/3s of the country's population, were highly industrialized and Western looking with strong ties to Germany.
Following the downfall of Communism there was a superficial unity in Czechoslovakia, but disputes began. Czechoslovakia's split up was the result of growing deep-rooted Slovak nationalism following the collapse of the Soviet bloc. When the Soviet yoke lifted from Czechoslovakia, historic nationalistic feelings arose again. In the two years after the collapse of communism in Prague, the Czech and Slovak republics were unable to agree on a political basis for future coexistence in one country.
The Czechs are adjusting to Western and international free-markets economy, while the Slovak Republic has inherited the communist legacy of rundown factories and incompetent government officials. The Czechs, representing 2/3s of the country's population, were highly industrialized and Western looking with strong ties to Germany.
The two regions were unable to agree on a political plan for coexistence. In the two years after the collapse of communism in Prague, the Czech and Slovak republics were unable to agree on a political basis for future coexistence in one country. The Slovaks had long been resentful of the Czech-dominated federal government and the two parts of the country could not agree on a political basis for their existence as a single country.
The 1992 elections in Czechoslovakia defined the directions that the Czechs and the Slovaks were taking. But only six months earlier, most Slovaks went into the crucial general elections of June 1992 intending to negotiate a new and looser union with their richer Czech cousins, but not to be divorced from them. In Czechoslovakia's 1992 elections, Slovaks voted to seek a looser confederation between the Czech and Slovak republics. In the election of 1992, the Slovak nationalist Movement for a Democratic Slovakia led by charismatic Vladamir Meciar, won a large percentage of the vote.
The Czechs voted for rapid market reforms and integration into Europe under the leadership of Vaclav Klaus and the Slovaks voted for the party of Vladimir Meciar and its avowedly separatist agenda. In June 1992 Czech politicians who wanted a rapid market reform and integration into the rest of Europe were elected, while the elected Slovaks were members of the nationalist-populist and separatist parties and were calling for greater autonomy.
The amicable separation became official January 1, 1993 after which the two began moving rapidly apart. On January 1, 1993, the agreed upon separation was official. Two new states were born on January 1, 1993. On New Year's day, 1993, Slovaks sloughed off a thousand year subservience to Hungary and seven decades as the junior partner in Czechoslovakia and celebrated the birth of a sovereign, independent republic.
No customs officials or border restrictions were deemed necessary. Free movement of goods and people was permitted.
Czech and Slovak leaders agreed to break up Czechoslovakia. By 20 June the intention to split into separate states was announced. On June 20, 1992, both sides agreed to vote on a split into two separate states by September 30, 1992.
In Czechoslovakia's 1992 elections, Slovaks voted to seek a looser confederation between the Czech and Slovak republics. He turned down the looser federation proposed by Vladimir Meciar, the Slovak leader.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s there were many cases of financial crime brought to trial (in both the state and federal courts) including three very high profile cases: Leona Helmsley, accused of tax evasion, Michael Milkin, accused of insider trading on Wall Street, and the looting of the North American Savings & Loan Company most notably by Janet Faye McKinzie. Janet Faye McKinzie was convicted of looting the now-defunct North America Savings & Loan.
In recent years, however, they are becoming increasingly severe in their sentencing in the wake of government and private business concerns about judges being soft on "white-collar" workers. Some judges have issued tough sentences, explicitly calling them a "deterrent" to other would-be criminals, such as "The sentence will send a message to other savings and loan owners that white-collar crime doesn't pay". Although there is no consistent pattern in sentencing, there was some tendency to impose harsher penalties on financial criminals than in previous years. Judges are increasingly imposing stiff sentences and levying stiff fines as deterrents.
In all three cases cited above, penalties included jail time of several years with no chance of parole in the first two to three years, financial penalties, restitution to those cheated, and community service hours. Increasingly harsh sentences for some of those found guilty have included a multi-year prison term, plus several years of probation during which community service is to be performed, plus a stiff fine and also restitution may be required.
Michael Milken-- the junk bond king--drew 10 years in jail, 3 years probation, 1,800 hours of community service, and $600 million in fines. A federal judge sentenced a stunned Michael Milken to 10 years in prison.
Poor communications facilities impact the low literacy rate. Indian communities have greater than average occurrences of such problems as drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, teen pregnancy, poor education, and unemployment.
Problems facing Indians and the reservation system include decreased funding for Indian programs; repeal of affirmative action laws; Indian culture and local regulations conflicting with federal or state laws, tribes not being fully recognized and having no access to federal funds; and banks unwilling to give Indians home loans that are backed by land held in trust. The nature of the land -- "held in trust" -- effectively shuts the Indians out of conventional home loan processes.
Federal aid programs are inadequate and impacted by outdated maps and census figures. Problems facing Indians and the reservation system include decreased funding for Indian programs; repeal of affirmative action laws; Indian culture and local regulations conflicting with federal or state laws, tribes not being fully recognized and having no access to federal funds; and banks unwilling to give Indians home loans that are backed by land held in trust. Federal funding is inadequate to satisfy the staggering needs of reservations.
Their sovereignty allows them to run casinos and enjoy extraordinary fishing and hunting rights. Privileges of tribal sovereignty include unique hunting and fishing rights, and the ability to sell gas and cigarettes tax-free, set zooming, and ban or sell alcohol. The system also recognizes Indian fishing and hunting rights and frees residents from state taxes, while providing the right to vote in local, state, and federal elections. They can determine local zoning, fishing and hunting rules; ban alcohol; and open casinos.

Reservations can set up casinos, bringing jobs and money. They can determine local zoning, fishing and hunting rules; ban alcohol; and open casinos. The 1988 Indian Gaming Act allowed reservations to operate bingo gaming and, subject to compacts with states, slot machine gaming. Their sovereignty allows them to run casinos and enjoy extraordinary fishing and hunting rights.
Several reservations near population centers have successfully established casinos that provide income to alleviate extreme poverty. Reservations can set up casinos, bringing jobs and money. Casinos have brought a new level of prosperity and opportunity to many tribes.
Indian tribes on reservations enjoy a unique legal status. Privileges of tribal sovereignty include unique hunting and fishing rights, and the ability to sell gas and cigarettes tax-free, set zooming, and ban or sell alcohol.
The system also recognizes Indian fishing and hunting rights and frees residents from state taxes, while providing the right to vote in local, state, and federal elections. State taxes are not levied on Indians' reservation income. Indians working on reservations pay federal income and social security taxes, but not state income, gasoline, or cigarette taxes.

Half of Native American Indians on reservations live in poverty with poor health care, substandard housing, and limited computer access. At least half the Indian population lives in poverty. At least half of U.S. Indians live in poverty.
Of the 1.43 million living on or near reservations, 29% are homeless and 59% live in substandard housing. Unemployment often exceeds 50%, 29% are homeless, and 59% live in substandard housing, many lacking plumbing and telephones. Half of Native American Indians on reservations live in poverty with poor health care, substandard housing, and limited computer access.
Tribal authorities deal with minor crimes but turn to federal help for more serious crime. The FBI or Bureau of Indian Affairs is responsible for serious crimes.
Minor crimes by Indians come under tribal authority. Tribal authorities deal with minor crimes but turn to federal help for more serious crime.
Continuing prejudice against Indians results in drunken attacks by whites. Indians are over twice as often victims of violent crimes, 60% of which are perpetrated by whites.
Indian communities have greater than average occurrences of such problems as drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, teen pregnancy, poor education, and unemployment. The Indian death rate is 35 times that of the rest of the population with high incidence of alcoholism, diabetes, accidents and suicides. There is poor health care and higher than average death rates from alcohol, diabetes, suicide, and accidents. The death rate is 35 times higher than the rest of the population.
Casinos aren't always successful and are often opposed by localities that don't want local gambling or competitors who fear untaxed competition. But some are troubled by legal battles with states that either outlaw gambling or want to tax the profits.
Violent crime is increasing, especially on poor reservations. Life on most Indian reservations is marked by extreme poverty, drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, failed education, rising crime rates and high unemployment.
On the positive side the reservation system has helped preserve Indian culture, to recognize Indian sovereignty and to provide federal funds for roads, schools, clinics and a welfare system. The federal government pays for reservation clinics, schools, and welfare.
Indian communities have greater than average occurrences of such problems as drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, teen pregnancy, poor education, and unemployment. Drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, poor education, teen births, and lack of jobs creates unemployment 10 times the national average.

Wetlands are important for flood prevention and impact climate, water preservation, soil erosion, and pollution. They play a role in controlling floods, conserving water, preventing soil-erosion, disposing of sewage, filtering of waste, adjusting the climate, and in hosting a great variety of plants and waterfowl. Wetlands, called earth's kidney, are important in filtering pollutants, regulating climate, conserving water, preventing erosion, controlling floods, and preserving biodiversity.
The Wetlands are a natural ecological system sometimes called "Earth's kidney". They are important natural ecological systems that provide social, economic, and ecological benefits.
In 1996 Wetlands International linked government and NGO groups to work for conservation. The launch of Wetlands International, an international conservation body, in 1996, represents a partnership between government and non-government interests with the goal of wetlands conservation.

Though precise figures are unavailable, estimates are that wetlands in the US are disappearing at the rate of about 70,000 to 100,000 acres a year. The remaining 100million acres are being depleted at the rate of 100,000 acres per year. Human activities threaten wetlands in many places, including Asia, Africa, and the US, where 100,000 acres per year have been lost.
The 1971 Ramsar Convention, aiming to conserve wetland habitats and enhance international cooperation, has 90 signatory countries. International efforts to protect wetlands are based on the Ramsar Convention of 1971 which gained 90 signatory nations.
They serve as a habitat for numerous varieties of flora and fauna, many of which are quite rare. They play a role in controlling floods, conserving water, preventing soil-erosion, disposing of sewage, filtering of waste, adjusting the climate, and in hosting a great variety of plants and waterfowl. They play important roles in filtering and cleansing water, preventing soil erosion, preventing soil and water pollution, serving as a reservoir for flood waters and in harboring fish, shellfish, wild plants, migratory birds, waterfowl and tiny organisms essential to the food chain.
International help with wetland restoration has come from the Netherlands, Finland, and the World Bank. The Nethrlands and Finland are funding programs in Uganda and China respectively.

Wetlands are bodies of land under water at least part of the year, and include marshland, lakes, rivers, and swamps. The term "wetlands" describes marshes, swamps, bogs and similar areas usually situated between dry land and bodies of water.
In 1996 Uganda established an environmental abuse reporting hot line and banned new draining of swamps for development. Active programs to protect wetlands are underway in countries as varied as China, Vietnam, India, Uganda and the United States. Efforts around the world include abuse hot lines and swamp-draining prohibitions by Uganda.
They include acetaminophen, as Tylenol, for pain relief, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as Advil, Aleve, Motrin, and topical pain-relieving ointments. An acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) is used to treat pain alone.
Procedures which claim adherents but lack scientific support include the Jacobson resonance machine which emits a weak magnetic field, injection of steroids and the drugs hyaheronan (Hyalgan) and hylan G-F20 (Synvisk) into the knee, arthroscopic surgery, acupuncture, tai chi, and stinging nettle. Hyaluronan (Hyalgan) and hylan G-F20 (Synvisk) are new injectable drugs.
Nutritional supplements -- particularly glucosamine sulfate, chondroitin sulfate -- have become trendy for treating osteoarthritis. Nontraditional approaches used to treat osteoarthritis include acupuncture, folk remedies, such as wearing copper bracelets, and nutritional supplements, such as glucosamine, chondroitin, and certain vitamins.

Surgery is often used relieve the pain and limited mobility of osteoarthritis. Knee and hip replacement can restore mobility.
They are painkillers that cut inflammation with no stomach distress. Research indicated that COX-2 drugs reduce inflammation similarly to traditional NSAIDs while causing fewer gastrointestinal side effects.
New cox-2 inhibitor drugs are proven as effective against pain, with fewer gastrointestinal side effects. They are painkillers that cut inflammation with no stomach distress. In 1999 the FDA approved a new class of Cox-2 inhibitors (Celebrex and Vioxx) which appeared to give pain relief without damage to the stomach, but it was not known whether there might be other side effects.
They include acetaminophen, as Tylenol, for pain relief, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as Advil, Aleve, Motrin, and topical pain-relieving ointments. Older NSAIDS include Advil, Daypro, Lodine, Naprosyn.
New NSAIDS called COX-2 inhibitors, such as Celebrex and Vioxx, are being used to reduce inflammation. Three new NSAIDS containing COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) inhibitors have been developed - meloxicam (Mobic), Celebra, and Vioxx. In 1999 the FDA approved a new class of Cox-2 inhibitors (Celebrex and Vioxx) which appeared to give pain relief without damage to the stomach, but it was not known whether there might be other side effects.

There is no evidence to back up claims of copper bracelets, shark cartilage, and alfalfa. Osteoarthritis therapies such as copper bracelets, shark cartilage, and snake or bee venom have been proven ineffective.
HMP-33, a ginger extract, and SAM-e also provide pain relief, seemingly without negative side effects. Research shows HMP-33 and SAM-e (S-Adenosylmethionine) give relief from pain with no negative side effects.
Glucosamine and chondroitin sooth knee pain as well as ibuprophen but without side effects. US studies find them to be safe and significantly more effective than placebo.
Crash tests, finally beginning in China, should include child dummies in the back seat. Crash tests, including tests with dummies in the rear seats provide valuable information for safety planners.
New Mexico in 1999 attacked automobile safety with a graduated licensing law requiring a learner's permit followed by an intermediate license, both with restrictions on night driving and number of young passengers aboard, and finally a full license if the driver has a clear record. In addition, states are enacting graduated licensing laws to limit new drivers until they gain experience.
Getting people to use them remains a problem, which has been addressed by installing use-sensors and enacting laws to stop and fine non-users. Its weakness lies in the failure of drivers and passengers to use it.
Devices were installed to prevent their deployment when passengers are too small. Dual front air bags became standard equipment, but they posed threats to children and small people. Dual inflation levels for air bags are proposed since some bags inflating in low speed crashes have been blamed for killing several people, mostly children.
In 2000 the state of New Jersey authorized police to stop and ticket drivers who are not wearing seat belts. Some states are enacting laws to require seat belt usage and some auto makers are installing audio and visual signals to show when belts are not engaged.

Researchers have suggested using "black boxes" in cars like those used in aircraft to record data pertinent to an auto crash to lead to safety improvements. Finally the installation and analysis of "black boxes" that record data in the last seconds before a crash will allow engineers to better understand crashes and the causes of injuries.
Bouchard and his Parti Quebecois retained control in 1998 provincial elections. In a 1998 provincial election Bouchard won more seats (but slightly less of the popular vote) and did not get enough votes to permit another referendum immediately. Bouchard's ruling party won re-election in the 1998 election.

The Supreme Court, hearing the case of Quebec separation, ruled that, under the Canadian Constitution and international law, Quebec could not separate unilaterally from Canada and that if separatists won a referendum on independence, the government would be obliged to negotiate with Quebec. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court decided against the constitutionality of unilateral secession. The issue was presented to the Supreme Court which ruled in August 1998 that Quebec could not separate unilaterally and if a referendum favored separation details would have to be negotiated with Canada. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled against unilateral secession, but stipulated that federal officials would be obligated to negotiate if a clear majority of Quebeckers voted for secession in a fair referendum.
Language and cultural differences divide Quebec, Canada's only province with a French-speaking majority, from the rest of the country. It stemmed from the feeling among Quebeckers that their culture is different from the rest of Canada -- more than 80 percent of the 7 million Quebeckers speak French.

Canada's Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, ruled out any declaration of independence even if Quebec voted for secession in another referendum. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien declared that unilateral secession was illegal and could only be accomplished through a constitutional amendment.
Canadian Prime Minister Chretien took a firm stand asserting that Quebec could not unilaterally secede without amendment of the Canadian Constitution. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien declared that unilateral secession was illegal and could only be accomplished through a constitutional amendment.
Polls also show support for separation had declined, although there was feeling that just the threat of separation is enough to bring about change. Polls indicated most Quebeckers didn't want another referendum. The Separatist movement appeared in shatters and polls showed only 41% favoring independence. However, support for separation was low.
In 1999, Chretien proposed legislation making secession attempts difficult for Quebec. Meanwhile, the federal government introduced a bill aimed at making separation attempts more difficult.
In the first referendum on independence, in May 1980, separatist gained 40 percent of votes in Quebec. The movement for separation of Quebec from Canada began in the 1960's leading to the first referendum in the province in May 1980 when 40% voted for independence. Quebeckers voted on two independence referendums, unsuccessfully in 1980 and nearly victoriously in 1995.
The movement for separation of Quebec from Canada began in the 1960's leading to the first referendum in the province in May 1980 when 40% voted for independence. The political movement for the province of Quebec to attain independence from Canada began in the 1960s. Since the separatist movement began in Quebec in the 1960's, the sentiment for breaking up Canada appeared to gain some momentum in recent years.
Quebeckers wanted the government to deal instead with economic conditions. Opinion indicated that Quebeckers wanted Bouchard to focus on the economy rather than independence.
The Quebec Premier resigned and the new leader, Lucien Bouchard, vowed to keep the independence movement alive. The Quebec Premier Parizeau resigned after defeat in the referendum and Lucien Bouchard stepped forward to assume the Premiership and leadership of the Party Quebecois (Separatist). Following the referendum, Jacques Parizeau, leader of Parti Quebecois and Quebec premier, resigned and was replaced by Lucien Bouchard, a separatist.

He promised another referendum on independence. The Quebec Premier resigned and the new leader, Lucien Bouchard, vowed to keep the independence movement alive. Bouchard pledged to hold another referendum if his party won the next election in 1998.
Proponents of Intelligent Design don't always posit God as the creator. Intelligent design avoids mention of God saying the complexity of the design of the cosmos requires an intelligent designer.
There are two advocacy perspectives on what to teach in American public school biology classes: evolution and creationism. Although there are gradations of emphasis, two basic perspectives are at the core of the debate over teaching of evolution, creation science or intelligent design in public school science classes.
There are two advocacy perspectives on what to teach in American public school biology classes: evolution and creationism. Although there are gradations of emphasis, two basic perspectives are at the core of the debate over teaching of evolution, creation science or intelligent design in public school science classes. Teaching the origins of life on earth is a controversial and emotional topic.
Scientists, teachers, business leaders and clergy say understanding evolution as the unifying principle of biology is important for college entrance exams, employment, personal health, and citizenship. Scientists, science teachers and their supporters see evolution as one of five unifying concepts linking all scientific disciplines.
Repeated U.S. Supreme Court rulings have found that creationism is not science, but a religious belief by some American fundamentalist Christians who literally interpret the Bible to mean the universe, the Earth and its creatures were created in six days by God only 10,000 years ago and that humans descended from Adam and Eve, not other life forms. They see creationism as a literal reading of Genesis clearly contradicted by science and intelligent design as little more than substitution of "intelligent designer" for "God" in the Genesis account, following court decisions against teaching creationism as science.
Supporters of creationism, creation science, and intelligent design are primarily fundamentalist Christians who have faith in the literal truth of the Bible. Repeated U.S. Supreme Court rulings have found that creationism is not science, but a religious belief by some American fundamentalist Christians who literally interpret the Bible to mean the universe, the Earth and its creatures were created in six days by God only 10,000 years ago and that humans descended from Adam and Eve, not other life forms.
Intelligent design avoids mention of God saying the complexity of the design of the cosmos requires an intelligent designer. Creationists introduced into classrooms theories as "intelligent design" -- the idea that the universe is so complex that it must have been designed on purpose by an intelligent designer. They want evolution to be fairly represented and juxtaposed with other theories of life, including the idea that the design and complexity of the design of the cosmos require an intelligent designer.
Eight-three percent of the pubic favor teaching evolution in public schools. Rep. Tom DeLay put the blame for the tragic Columbine High massacre on teaching children "that they are nothing but glorified apes who are evolutionized out of some primordial soup of mud." In 1999 a poll showed 83% of Americans favoring teaching evolution in the public schools and 68% thinking one can both believe in evolution and that God created humans and guided their development.
According to evolutionists, scientific evidence shows that life began almost 4 million years ago with simple organisms, from which humans and all other forms of life evolved gradually over millions of years. Evolution science holds that the Earth is billions of years old, and that all species, including humans, arose over millions of years through genetic mutations and natural selection from a few initial life forms.
Proponents of evolutionary theory use a plethora of evidence, including fossils and carbon-dating, to show how life forms mutated and branched out from common ancestors in the billions of years since the world came into existence. Evolution science holds that the Earth is billions of years old, and that all species, including humans, arose over millions of years through genetic mutations and natural selection from a few initial life forms. The Big Bang Theory, suggests that the universe originated in a colossal explosion about 15 billion years ago.
He promised free and democratic elections and suggested amnesty for some combatants. In December 1994 Russian troops were sent into Chechnya to crush a separatist drive led by Dzhokhar Dudayev. In March 1996 Boris Yeltsin halted the offensive, initiating a partial withdrawal from Chechen areas, but warned that more terrorist attacks would be dealt with severely.
In 1996, accords were signed granting Chechnya de facto independence. At this time Chechnya won de facto independence and could run its own affairs, but was left devastated and lawless.
After fifteen months of fighting against Chechen separatists since December 1994, the Russian government announced its intention to withdraw troop stage-by-stage from Chechnya in an effort to end the conflict. The Russian response has included all-out attempts to occupy Chechnya in 1994-96 and after August 2, 1999, securing borders with Chechnya, air strikes and artillery attacks.

In August and September of 1999, armed Chechen groups invaded neighboring Dagestan, inflicting heavy casualties on Russian troops. In August 1998, Russia launched a massive anti-terrorist military campaign in Chechnya after separatists invaded the neighboring republic of Dagestan and carried out a series of incursions and explosions claiming the lives of over 300 people in several Russian cities, including Moscow. Russia began its military operations inside Chechnya in late September after Chechen rebels' armed incursions into neighboring Dagestan and a spate of terrorist acts in Russian cities that killed over 300.
Sometimes the air strikes, and artillery strikes have been against cities and strategic targets and at other times against Chechen positions including those in mountainous terrain. They first bombed suspected rebel bases, then economic installations and civilian communications facilities. Russian air strikes were conducted against economic installations, communications facilities, rebel bases, storage areas, bridges, and roads.
Russia was determined to liberate Chechnya from the terrorists and restore normal life and by the end of 1999 Russian troops occupied over 60% of Chechnya. In November 1999 Russia announced its intent to liberate all of Chechnya by February 2000, but by May 2000 only 2/3 of the country was occupied and weekly losses continued on both sides. By November 2000, the Russians occupied 60% of Chechen territory and drove some 2500 rebels into the mountain areas.

Up to 200,000 people were thought to have fled Chechnya since the Russians began their offensive, and some 3,600 people, mainly civilians, were killed according to Chechen leaders. Some 3,600 Chechen civilians were killed and almost 200,000 fled the country. The turbulence resulted in thousands of Chechens trying to leave the republic, and many human rights issues came under examination .
The Russians continue to face rebel "hit-and-run" attacks. Guerilla and terrorist attacks continued.
Russia maintained that Chechnya did not have the right to secede. The Russians say Chechnya must stay within the Russian Confederation.
After extensive investigation of recovered aircraft parts and both black box data recorders, NTSB investigators found no evidence that mechanical or electrical problems or an explosion caused the crash. However, thorough evaluation of the flight data recorder, cockpit voice recorder, radar data, and wreckage led investigators to determine there was no sign of mechanical failure.

However, thorough evaluation of the flight data recorder, cockpit voice recorder, radar data, and wreckage led investigators to determine there was no sign of mechanical failure.
Radar tracks of the flight during its final minutes indicated the plane went into a dive but climbed again before going into an extremely steep dive during which some breaking up of the plane occurred. According to Air Force radar, the plane suddenly entered a drastically steep dive to 16,000 feet, slowed and climbed back to 24,000 feet, then turned again in its fatal plunge. The plane plummeted 15,000 feet, but then climbed 8000 feet before its final fall to the ocean. The plane dropped at near supersonic speed for 9,000 meters, then climbed for 2,400 meters before falling and breaking apart.
Electromagnetic interferences by local military radars could have caused shutdown of computerized autopilot, elevators, and engines, but radar evidence is classified. In September, a computer shutdown caused by electromagnetic interference from military radars was speculated. Egyptian authorities discounted the suicide theory and raised the possibility that the plane's problems were caused by electromagnetic interference from military radars.

One thrust reverser had been previously deactivated because of a problem and there was speculation that a thrust reverser had deployed. Initial speculation centered on a thrust reverser (deactivated in Cairo).
Initial speculation that malfunctioning reverse thrusters caused the crash was disproved. Initial speculation centered on a thrust reverser (deactivated in Cairo). One thrust reverser had been previously deactivated because of a problem and there was speculation that a thrust reverser had deployed.
An on-board computer failure, stopping the transponder and providing erroneous data, was speculated. The transponder had also stopped working. Electrical power ceased, turning off the transponder and flight data recorder. An in-flight electrical problem could explain why the transponder stopped working, and computer failure could lead to erratic behavior as the pilots tried to regain control.
Data from one Black Box showed that both engines had been switched off from the cabin and that the elevators, which raise or lower the plane's nose were in an uneven setting, a move not believed possible for the crew to make. After extensive investigation of recovered aircraft parts and both black box data recorders, NTSB investigators found no evidence that mechanical or electrical problems or an explosion caused the crash.
Data from one Black Box showed that both engines had been switched off from the cabin and that the elevators, which raise or lower the plane's nose were in an uneven setting, a move not believed possible for the crew to make. Flight data showed that as it flew at 33,000 feet, the aircraft's automatic pilot was shut off, throttles cut back, and engines shut off from the cockpit.
Data from one Black Box showed that both engines had been switched off from the cabin and that the elevators, which raise or lower the plane's nose were in an uneven setting, a move not believed possible for the crew to make. Flight data indicated the tail section elevators moved out of unison.
Shortly after taking off from John F. Kennedy International Airport for Cairo, EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the Atlantic early Sunday, October 31, 1999, killing all 217 people on board. EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed on October 31, 1999 after departing JFK Airport.
Neither pilot nor co-pilot sent a distress message. Radio communication between the crew and air traffic controllers was routine and they did not advise of either an emergency or mechanical problem before or during the dive. There was no distress call, and an emergency descent was virtually ruled out. There were no radio reports of trouble.
Flight data indicated the tail section elevators moved out of unison. The tail elevators were in uneven positions, indicating a possible malfunction, but it is not known if this was a cause or byproduct of the crash. Data from one Black Box showed that both engines had been switched off from the cabin and that the elevators, which raise or lower the plane's nose were in an uneven setting, a move not believed possible for the crew to make. The flight recorder was recovered on November 9 and revealed that the autopilot was disconnected, the descent appeared "controlled," the cockpit turned off both engines, and the elevators were out of unison.
Both engines had been switched off from the cockpit, something experienced pilots would not do. The flight recorder was recovered on November 9 and revealed that the autopilot was disconnected, the descent appeared "controlled," the cockpit turned off both engines, and the elevators were out of unison. Data from one Black Box showed that both engines had been switched off from the cabin and that the elevators, which raise or lower the plane's nose were in an uneven setting, a move not believed possible for the crew to make.
An on-board computer failure, stopping the transponder and providing erroneous data, was speculated. Some speculated that an in-flight electrical or computer problem caused the crash. An in-flight electrical problem could explain why the transponder stopped working, and computer failure could lead to erratic behavior as the pilots tried to regain control.
Investigators found little in recent activities, background, medical history, and emotional stability of crew and passengers. A criminal act involving a hijacking, suicide, or a crew fight was also possible and the background, medical history, and emotional stability of the passengers and crew were examined.

A criminal act involving a hijacking, suicide, or a crew fight was also possible and the background, medical history, and emotional stability of the passengers and crew were examined.
The cockpit voice recorder was recovered on November 15. Cockpit voice recordings indicated that someone uttered a prayer in Arabic just before the autopilot disengaged raising questions of a possible terrorist or suicide act.
The National Transportation Safety Board stated on January 21, 2000 that there was no sign of mechanical failure. After extensive investigation of recovered aircraft parts and both black box data recorders, NTSB investigators found no evidence that mechanical or electrical problems or an explosion caused the crash.
Egyptian officials continued to seek other possible causes. Egyptian authorities discounted the suicide theory and raised the possibility that the plane's problems were caused by electromagnetic interference from military radars. Egyptian officials dispute these theories, saying the likely cause was an unexplained problem in the plane's elevator control system, a missile, a bomb, or electromagnetic interference.
The plane plummeted 15,000 feet, but then climbed 8000 feet before its final fall to the ocean. Shortly after taking off from John F. Kennedy International Airport for Cairo, EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the Atlantic early Sunday, October 31, 1999, killing all 217 people on board.
Shortly after taking off from John F. Kennedy International Airport for Cairo, EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the Atlantic early Sunday, October 31, 1999, killing all 217 people on board. There were no survivors.
It contained the co-pilot chanting, "I rely on God" and the pilot ordering actions to control the aircraft. The prayer he uttered and final comments on the cockpit voice recorder led investigators to suspect his suicide. Cockpit voice recordings indicated that someone uttered a prayer in Arabic just before the autopilot disengaged raising questions of a possible terrorist or suicide act. The cockpit voice recorder captured someone uttering a prayer before the autopilot disengaged.
An in-flight electrical problem could explain why the transponder stopped working, and computer failure could lead to erratic behavior as the pilots tried to regain control. Some speculated that an in-flight electrical or computer problem caused the crash.
The plane's copilot had been having problems and had exhibited strange behavior in a New York hotel before the flight suggesting he may have deliberately crashed the plane. The prayer he uttered and final comments on the cockpit voice recorder led investigators to suspect his suicide. Other lingering theories include hijacking, terrorism, crew fight, or a deliberate criminal or suicidal act by the backup copilot.
The plane dropped at near supersonic speed for 9,000 meters, then climbed for 2,400 meters before falling and breaking apart. The plane plummeted 15,000 feet, but then climbed 8000 feet before its final fall to the ocean.
According to Air Force radar, the plane suddenly entered a drastically steep dive to 16,000 feet, slowed and climbed back to 24,000 feet, then turned again in its fatal plunge. Radar tracks of the flight during its final minutes indicated the plane went into a dive but climbed again before going into an extremely steep dive during which some breaking up of the plane occurred.
However, since the violent occurrences in Littleton, Colorado and Jonesboro, Arkansas, school officials nationwide are taking precautions to prevent violence in their schools. Violent occurrences and shootings resulting in the deaths of students and teachers in several parts of the country have forced school authorities to implement measures to prevent more tragedy. A series of well-publicized school shooting in Colorado, Mississippi, Kentucky, Arkansas, and Oregon caused schools and school districts to take measures to prevent school violence and shootings.
Some schools have implemented a dress code that forbids "gang-type" and baggy clothing that could conceal weapons. These preventive measures included posting armed security officers in schools; using metal detectors and surveillance cameras, conducting searches for weapons in schools; tightening access to campuses and improving screening for school visitors; locking most school entrances during the school day; installing a hot line and tip box for reporting incidents that might lead to violence; expelling students who bring a gun to school; requiring school uniforms; making it harder to conceal a weapon by requiring transparent book bags and forbidding baggy clothing.
Canvas book bags are banned in some places. These preventive measures included posting armed security officers in schools; using metal detectors and surveillance cameras, conducting searches for weapons in schools; tightening access to campuses and improving screening for school visitors; locking most school entrances during the school day; installing a hot line and tip box for reporting incidents that might lead to violence; expelling students who bring a gun to school; requiring school uniforms; making it harder to conceal a weapon by requiring transparent book bags and forbidding baggy clothing. Some schools require "see through" book bags and prohibit backpacks. Safety measures adopted by school districts include school uniforms or dress codes, student identification badges, and transparent book bags.
They are promoting friendship and trying to negate rage. Children are being taught to better deal with problems before they grow into rage. Theses included fostering an environment where violent behavior is not tolerated; teaching students social skills as anger management; introducing conflict-resolution programs; and building partnerships between schools, law enforcement, social services, parents, and the community.
Schools keep all but main doors locked, require visitor passes, and some have installed panic alarms. These preventive measures included posting armed security officers in schools; using metal detectors and surveillance cameras, conducting searches for weapons in schools; tightening access to campuses and improving screening for school visitors; locking most school entrances during the school day; installing a hot line and tip box for reporting incidents that might lead to violence; expelling students who bring a gun to school; requiring school uniforms; making it harder to conceal a weapon by requiring transparent book bags and forbidding baggy clothing. Some of these measures are modifications or additions to the school's physical plant such as installing metal detectors and surveillance cameras, keeping most doors locked, removing lockers that could be used to store weaponry, removing things that could provide concealment for a sniper.
The goal is to create a positive group atmosphere and to heal troubled students. Hot lines and tip boxes have been established to identify students with problems that could lead to violence. Other preventative measures include anti-bullying programs, mentor programs, increased school psychologists and counselors, identifying and treating troubled students before they become dangerous, and hot lines and tip lines for reporting disturbing student behavior.
They are instituting programs to bring about conflict resolution and to stop bullying. Other preventative measures include anti-bullying programs, mentor programs, increased school psychologists and counselors, identifying and treating troubled students before they become dangerous, and hot lines and tip lines for reporting disturbing student behavior. They are also instituting anti-bullying campaigns.
Some of these measures are modifications or additions to the school's physical plant such as installing metal detectors and surveillance cameras, keeping most doors locked, removing lockers that could be used to store weaponry, removing things that could provide concealment for a sniper. Physical building security measures include removing lockers, on-campus armed guards, metal detectors, gun- and bomb-sniffing dogs, and video surveillance.
Some officers are armed and some bring dogs trained to sniff out explosives and the officers sometimes conduct weapons sweeps. Physical building security measures include removing lockers, on-campus armed guards, metal detectors, gun- and bomb-sniffing dogs, and video surveillance. These preventive measures included posting armed security officers in schools; using metal detectors and surveillance cameras, conducting searches for weapons in schools; tightening access to campuses and improving screening for school visitors; locking most school entrances during the school day; installing a hot line and tip box for reporting incidents that might lead to violence; expelling students who bring a gun to school; requiring school uniforms; making it harder to conceal a weapon by requiring transparent book bags and forbidding baggy clothing. External safety measures include security checks by armed officers assigned to the schools, student identification cards, random locker inspections, metal detectors, panic buttons in the classrooms, video cameras on school buses, and erection of fences, increased lighting, and trimming of shrubbery around the school.
Police provided Lawrence no first aid as he bled to death. London police were slow to act, first in trying to save Lawrence's life and later in investigating the crime.
The Prime Minister announced a radical overhaul of race discrimination laws. The Labor government of Tony Blair promised a radical overhaul of race discrimination laws and hoped that in ten years every police force in England and Wales would reflect the racial make-up of the area it served. The report prompted the British government to order a major overhaul of the country's racial discrimination laws and their application to the police and government.
Some new arrests were made in the case and the police made some financial compensation to the Lawrences for their mishandling of the case. Police offered Lawrence's parents $78,000 each.
Prince Charles launched a scholarship for minority students interested in architecture in memory of Stephen Lawrence. In 2000, Price Charles launched a scholarship in memory of Lawrence to open up architecture, Lawrence's chosen field of study, to ethnic minorities. In September 2000, the Prince of Wales established the Stephen Lawrence architectural scholarship for minorities.
Stephen's parents, Jamaican immigrants, publicly pursued justice for their son, even bringing two suspects to civil court. Stephen Lawrence, a promising 18 year-old son of Jamaican immigrant parents, was stabbed to death at a London bus stop in April 1993.
Britain overall is 94% white and has never had a civil rights movement. To many, Lawrence became a symbol of racial struggle in Britain, a country that had never had a civil rights movement.
Stephen's parents, Jamaican immigrants, publicly pursued justice for their son, even bringing two suspects to civil court. However, the determination of Lawrence's parents to seek justice kept the issue alive.

After an incompetent investigation, the case collapsed before trial. Police acted slowly and incompetently investigating his murder. But their investigation was so flawed that the state prosecution had to abandon the case due to insufficient evidence. Police racism is believed to have led to poor handling of the case against the five.
Three of five suspects in the killing were questioned and released. Three of the alleged killers were tried and acquitted.
When none of the suspects were brought to trial, they filed a civil suit against them. After an incompetent investigation, the case collapsed before trial. But their investigation was so flawed that the state prosecution had to abandon the case due to insufficient evidence.
In 1996 Stephen's parents, initiated a civil suit, where three were acquitted and the other two were dismissed, which prompted widespread public outrage. When three suspects were acquitted in the civil suit, the public was outraged at the incompetence of the investigation and the suspect's attitudes at the inquiry.
The five were pelted with bottles by enraged crowds, and could face perjury charges. Angry crowds protested as they testified and pelted them with bottles as they left the inquiry.
Racism in the police department was exposed. In Feb 1999, a government report found London's police force "riven with pernicious and institutionalized racism". A government report into the incident found London's police force to be rife with "pernicious and institutionalized racism". London's Metropolitan Police, according to a later government report were found to be "riven with pernicious and institutionalized racism".
On April 22, 1993 five young white men, used a racial epithet and stabbed Stephen Lawrence, 18, black, a promising student standing, at a bus stop in London. The racially-motivated murder was committed by a gang of white males.
The first children adopted from foreign countries had only their adoptive parents for support and often suffered from discrimination. Most international adoptees look different than their white, middle-class parents and come from very different cultures creating issues of cultural identity and racial bias. Some adopted foreign children, mainly Asiatics, have problems with race issues, or loss of their self-identity. U.S. families and their foreign adoptees struggle with race and culture identity, and racial bias.
In 1999, 16,396 adopted children came to the US from abroad. Many US couples look to international adoptions because of a smaller and smaller supply of white American-born infants and the expense in competing for them.
Most children came from Russia, China, and Korea. Russia and China, the primary sources for adoption by Americans, have recently passed laws that put tighter restrictions on the procedures for adoption.
African orphans are almost ignored. US families rarely adopt children from Africa.
Many US couples look to international adoptions because of a smaller and smaller supply of white American-born infants and the expense in competing for them. There is a crisis of demand for decreasing supplies of white American-born infants, due to abortion, birth control.
Changes in Chinese law restrict foreigner adoptions by encouraging domestic adoption of multiple children by younger families who are not childless, an exception to China's one child per family rule. Russia and China, the primary sources for adoption by Americans, have recently passed laws that put tighter restrictions on the procedures for adoption.
Russia exports more adopted children, mostly to the U.S., than any other country, and is the world's largest supplier of Caucasian adoptees. Russia has replaced China as the nation providing most children for adoption in the US and those two countries have been amending their laws to prevent abuses in adoptions.
The Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoptions establishes safeguards so that international adoptions meet global standards to protect children. In July 2000, the US ratified the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, which was created to establish guidelines for international adoptions, harmonize the practices of different countries, improve the treatment of children, and curtail corruption, fraud and smuggling in the process.
Russia and China, the primary sources for adoption by Americans, have recently passed laws that put tighter restrictions on the procedures for adoption. Russia tightened control over foreigner adoptions by encouraging domestic adoptions and banning intermediaries, such as the Russian Mafia.
The American Psychiatric Association first described it in 1980, and some four to twelve percent of American children are now thought to have the disorder. It is estimated that from three to five or even nine percent of children have the disorder, which twenty percent may outgrow. ADHD, a common psychiatric illness that affects 3-9% of all children, is difficult to diagnose because there is no easy test like a blood test.
ADHD, a common psychiatric illness that affects 3-9% of all children, is difficult to diagnose because there is no easy test like a blood test. Until recently there have been no biological or medical tests to confirm diagnosis. It is difficult to diagnose ADHD because there are other kinds of problems, such as anxiety and depression, that may cause the same symptoms.
Outward symptoms generally include impulsiveness, inability to concentrate, difficulty in learning, and restlessness. ADHD, a chemical disorder in the brain, can cause impulsivity, inability to concentrate, and difficulty learning.
ADHD, a chemical disorder in the brain, can cause impulsivity, inability to concentrate, and difficulty learning. Outward symptoms generally include impulsiveness, inability to concentrate, difficulty in learning, and restlessness.
Type A is characterized by inattentiveness and distractability, Type B by hyperactivity and impulsive behavior, and Type C a combination of the two. Girls have Type A, characterized by inattentiveness and distractibility; boys have type B and are hyperactive and impulsive.
ADHD, a chemical disorder in the brain, can cause impulsivity, inability to concentrate, and difficulty learning. Brain scans show a chemical abnormality. ADD/ADHD is diagnosed through behavioral patterns but many of those afflicted have been found to have a high concentration of a key brain protein, a dopamine transporter, which could lead to a clinical diagnosis.
If approved, a 90% effective biological test monitoring activity in the front of the brain will be the first laboratory procedure for diagnosing ADHD. A clinic associated with the University of Tennessee claims a test involving monitoring the front region of the brain is 90% effective in diagnosis. Also in 2000, a biological test was developed that monitored activity in the front region of the brain, proving 90% effective in diagnosis.
Behavior-modification therapy is the primary treatment in Britain but in the U.S. drugs have been found more effective. Medication so far appears to be more effective than behavior modification therapy when treating ADHD alone.
However, problems still exist: undesirable side effects, abusive use and theft of Ritalin for psychic effects, over diagnosing and over prescribing, and accusations of parental neglect by failing to give the prescribed medication to their children. Critics say that doctors are too quick to diagnose ADHD and over-prescribe drugs for children. Some critics think the drugs are over-prescribed and suppress a child's natural spontaneity rather than correcting a brain chemistry imbalance. Many parents and experts, however, believe that doctors are throwing medication at children as a quick way of quieting them without trying less invasive methods such as behavior modification therapy.
ADHD, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, is a neurological and genetic disorder characterized by impulsivity, inattentiveness, and lack of inhibition and self-control. Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) are neurological and genetic disorders that are evident in childhood and continue through adulthood.
ADHD was thought to be a temporary condition for children but recent findings suggest that it may be a chronic condition that can last a lifetime and can cause difficulty with social life, school and careers. Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) are neurological and genetic disorders that are evident in childhood and continue through adulthood.
Controversies surrounding ADD/ADHD treatment are that no one knows the long-range effects of the drugs. Use of those drugs to treat ADD/ADHD is highly controversial. There has been much controversy around diagnosis and treatment of ADHD.

To face competition from online marketing, the ABA has created its own online store for independent booksellers, Book Sense. To stay competitive, traditional booksellers increased personal service, sponsored special events, and began selling online and offering broad search capabilities.
California sellers urged that state to collect taxes on major online retailers such as Amazon. It censured author Frank McCourt for participating in chainstore advertising, challenged barnesandnoble.com's claim "If we don't have your book nobody does," led successful opposition to B&N's plan to purchase the largest book distributor (threatening independents with reduced service and compromised records), and joined the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association in urging collection of taxes from on-line bookstores.
To meet online competition, the ABA opened Book Sense and Contentville, online selling and commentary sites serving as hubs for individual stores. To face competition from online marketing, the ABA has created its own online store for independent booksellers, Book Sense. The first is Booksense.com, a "hub site" for hundreds of individual sites created and maintained by local stores. The Independents also established its own national online store, Book Sense, to stave off fierce competition from Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com.

To stay competitive, traditional booksellers increased personal service, sponsored special events, and began selling online and offering broad search capabilities. Some shops cater to niche markets, others entice customers with special service and community events.
The chains and independents have also established online sites. Many small booksellers developed websites to have an online presence for advertising and selling their books. To stay competitive, traditional booksellers increased personal service, sponsored special events, and began selling online and offering broad search capabilities.
Big chains are proliferating and squeezing out independent bookstores. Independent bookstores have been seriously damaged by superstore chains and also have been set back by increasing online sales. Independent booksellers have had great difficulty competing against the major chain stores, Barnes & Noble and Borders Books and online giant, Amazon.
Their portion of the book market was cut in half during this decade and membership in their trade organization, the American Booksellers Association (ABA) dropped from 5,200 to 3,500. In the 1990s, membership in the American Bookseller Association, which represents the independent stores, dropped by almost half, as bookstores were forced to close their doors. The American Booksellers Association (ABA) that represents the independents saw its membership drop from 5,200 to less than 3,500.

The Concorde had an impeccable safety record until July 25, 2000, when Air France charter flight AF4590 crashed less than two minutes after taking off from Charles de Gaulle Airport. The only supersonic passenger plane--the Concorde--crashed on July 25, 2000, killing all 109 on board and 4 on the ground. In July 2000, a French Concorde crashed immediately after take-off, the first in the history of Concorde flights. The fleet of 13 supersonic planes flew regularly from London and Paris to New York until July 25, 2000, the date of a tragic crash near Paris.
The first passenger flight was in January 1976. On January 21, 1976, the first Concorde passenger flight occured. The supersonic passenger jet, Concorde, has been flying trans-Atlantic and charter routes for almost 25 years. Developed by the French and British under a 1962 agreement, it made its first passenger flight in 1976.
All 109 aboard the aircraft, most of whom were German tourists, and four persons at the crash site died. German tourists comprised most of the 109 passengers on board when the Concorde slammed into a small hotel, only two miles from the airport killing all aboard and four people on the ground. Almost all of the passengers were Germans going to New York.
The Concorde had an impeccable safety record until July 25, 2000, when Air France charter flight AF4590 crashed less than two minutes after taking off from Charles de Gaulle Airport. In July 2000, a French Concorde crashed immediately after take-off, the first in the history of Concorde flights. Until then, the Concorde exhibited some minor problems, but had a perfect safety record.
The plane had 100 seats and flew 1,300 mph at 60,000 feet. The needle-nosed aircraft flies at 60,000 feet and 1,350 mph completing its journey from London to New York in about 3 hours, 30 minutes.
Indications are that a piece of scrap metal on the runway punctured a tire, chunks of which ruptured a fuel tank next to two engines which ignited escaping fuel. Investigators in France determined the probable cause of the crash was a 16-inch piece of metal on the runway that caused a tire to blow out, sending debris from the tire through the fuel tanks, triggering a fire that shut down two engines. An investigation revealed the cause was a piece of metal on the runway that gashed a tire. The metal cut the Concorde's tire and flying rubber damaged the engines causing a fuel leak that burst into flame, too late to abort.
German tourists comprised most of the 109 passengers on board when the Concorde slammed into a small hotel, only two miles from the airport killing all aboard and four people on the ground. The plane struck a hotel near Paris, killing all 109 aboard and four on the ground. It crashed into a small hotel.

Air France paid each family $20,000 to cover immediate expenses. Air France paid $20,000 each to surviving families to cover immediate expenses.
Flights from London soon resumed. Air France and British Airways immediately cancelled all Concorde flights but British Airways resumed them the next day.
Air France and British Airways immediately cancelled all Concorde flights but British Airways resumed them the next day. All the Concordes were grounded and their future use is uncertain. All supersonic planes out of Paris were immediately grounded. Air France immediately grounded its fleet and British Airways stopped flights on August 15.
All the Concordes were grounded and their future use is uncertain. A month later London cancelled all Concorde flights ending an era in high-speed travel.
Air France was investigating modifications to insure safety and sued Continental on September 27. Air France filed a lawsuit against Continental for its role leading up to the crash.
1,500 mourners gathered in Cologne for memorial services. Memorial services were held in Paris, in Cologne, Germany, and later at the crash site.
The only supersonic passenger plane--the Concorde--crashed on July 25, 2000, killing all 109 on board and 4 on the ground. The supersonic transport Concorde was a joint Anglo-French development begun in 1962. The supersonic passenger jet, Concorde, has been flying trans-Atlantic and charter routes for almost 25 years. The fleet of 13 supersonic planes flew regularly from London and Paris to New York until July 25, 2000, the date of a tragic crash near Paris.
Just twenty of the transports were built and only British Airways and Air France flew them. British airways and Air France, the only companies operating Concordes, own ten and six, respectively.
Russian navy rescue efforts were complicated by strong underwater currents and near zero visibility at the 450 feet depth where the vessel was trapped and by heavy surface storms. The 14,000-ton submarine settled 354 to 450 feet down, trapping 118 sailors. On August 12, 2000 the 118-man Russian submarine Kursk sank to 350 feet in the Barents Sea during naval exercises.
On August 19, 2000, a Russian nuclear submarine with 118 men aboard sank to the bottom of the Barents Sea while on a training mission. On August 12, 2000 the 118-man Russian submarine Kursk sank to 350 feet in the Barents Sea during naval exercises. The boat, one of Russia's largest, was commissioned in 1996 and carried a crew of 118. The 14,000-ton submarine settled 354 to 450 feet down, trapping 118 sailors.
Nuclear reactors powering the ship were taken off line and no radiation leaks detected. Its nuclear reactor was shut down and attempts to hook air lines failed, so oxygen would last only a few days. The ship was reported not to be carrying nuclear weapons and its nuclear reactor had been switched off.
Russia rejected a French offer. Russia turned down a French offer of help and Germany's offer of medical specialists.
Rescue vehicles arrived Saturday. These rescue teams arrived at the scene on August 19 and began the descent to the Kursk on the 20th.
Lifting the Kursk to the surface would take a year and be costly and might never be done. The Russians hoped to raise the boat in the summer of 2001 at an anticipated cost of $45 million.
Russian navy rescue efforts were complicated by strong underwater currents and near zero visibility at the 450 feet depth where the vessel was trapped and by heavy surface storms. Russian efforts to reach the submarine using underwater capsules failed and Russia talked to NATO officials.
Russians say the explosion was caused by collision with a non-Russian vessel or a not uncommonly encountered WWII-era mine. Russian officials speculated that the Kursk collided with another vessel, probably a foreign submarine, or encountered a World War II mine.
After initially refusing Western aid, the Russians agreed to accept rescue submarines and divers from Britain and Norway. Initially, top officials refused foreign assistance.
On Aug 21, a British mini-submarine could not dock with the terribly damaged escape hatch. A British mini-submarine was unable to dock with an escape hatch.
Russians say the explosion was caused by collision with a non-Russian vessel or a not uncommonly encountered WWII-era mine. Russian officials speculated that the Kursk collided with another vessel, probably a foreign submarine, or encountered a World War II mine. The Russians, who ultimately signed a contract with Dutch and Belgian companies to retrieve the submarine, continued to insist throughout that the sinking was caused by a collision.
Repeated efforts to hook up air and fuel lines and dock with the escape hatch were frustrated by bad sea conditions. By the seventh day, repeated attempts to dock with an escape hatch failed and Russian officials were virtually certain that all the crew were dead. On Aug 21, a British mini-submarine could not dock with the terribly damaged escape hatch.

The Russian Oscar II-class, atomic powered submarine, the Kursk, sank in the Barents Sea on August 12, 2000 during a naval exercise.
Initial reports indicated that the ship may have been involved in a collision or could have been damaged by an explosion. Possible causes of the accident were a collision (favored Russian explanation, perhaps as the Kursk rose to periscope level), an onboard explosion (most likely explanation, probably involving a torpedo and triggering further detonations), or hitting a WWII mine. The United States believed one of the Kursk's torpedoes misfired causing a massive explosion. Russians say the explosion was caused by collision with a non-Russian vessel or a not uncommonly encountered WWII-era mine.
It involves a surface warming of the eastern and central Pacific Ocean around the equator when trade winds weaken. The El Nino weather pattern occurs when weakening trade winds allow warm water in the western Pacific to pulse to the east. El Nino is a periodic weather phenomenon caused by abnormal warming of the water in the eastern Pacific.
It usually occurs around December every 3-6 years. El Nino is a disruptive weather phenomenon that usually occurs every three to four years on the average. El Nino is a periodic weather phenomenon caused by abnormal warming of the water in the eastern Pacific.
El Nino causes reversals of normal weather patterns worldwide, resulting in drought in usually wet locales and flooding in arid areas. Basically, it reverses normal weather patterns, resulting in drought in usually wet locations and flooding in arid areas. El Nino and El Nina are opposite extremes of continuous but far ranging changes in water surface temperature, precipitation, trade winds, and sea level in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, which portend extreme changes and reversals in usual global climate and weather patterns, resulting in dangerous temperature changes, storms, floods and droughts world wide, with severe economic impacts, disease and death. El Nino is a disruptive weather phenomenon that usually occurs every three to four years on the average.
Trade winds may reverse direction. It can disrupt climate around the world, producing extra rain in the southeastern U.S., Peru and Ecuador during the winter, while causing drought in the western Pacific as well as the slowing of trade winds and changes in sea levels.
Days may lengthen because of Earth's rotation. These phenomena even slow the Earth's rotation, which has long-term global climate implications.
El Nino may lessen global warming by temporarily stemming the release of carbon dioxide from the Pacific. It may also help cut global warming by temporarily stemming release of carbon dioxide from the Pacific Ocean.
La Nina is the phenomenon of rapidly cooling equatorial waters in the central Pacific. La Nina alternates with El Nino and is fueled by abnormally cold water in the eastern Pacific. There is abnormal cooling of the Pacific sea surface creating a colder, stronger jet stream in the upper atmosphere.
It typically lasts a year. It can last for one year causing cooler conditions in central North America and dry warm conditions in the southern states that can be just as disruptive as El Nino.
El Nino and El Nina are opposite extremes of continuous but far ranging changes in water surface temperature, precipitation, trade winds, and sea level in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, which portend extreme changes and reversals in usual global climate and weather patterns, resulting in dangerous temperature changes, storms, floods and droughts world wide, with severe economic impacts, disease and death. La Nina reverses El Nino's effects but also brings drought to some parts of the planet while drenching others. It develops every several years and works in reverse of El Nino.
The El Nino detection system consists of 70 buoy-borne stations monitoring Pacific winds and waves. Predicting El Nino and its behavior is aided by computer modeling, a detection system that monitors Pacific winds and waves through 70 stations floating on buoys, and weather satellites that detect ocean warming. Scientific technologies and techniques for studying these phenomena include: computer modeling, simulation and forecasting of global climate and weather; onsite and remote satellite measurement of changes in weather data, deep ocean waves, sea level, surface temperature, greenhouse gas concentrations, clouds, rain, severe storms, sun spot activity, and sediment layers; and weather-correlated epidemiological studies.

NASA satellites measure sea surface temperatures. Computer module studies and satellite systems allow for a better understanding of how El Nino and La Nina form but, unfortunately, when they will develop or what they hold for the future still cannot be predicted. Scientific technologies and techniques for studying these phenomena include: computer modeling, simulation and forecasting of global climate and weather; onsite and remote satellite measurement of changes in weather data, deep ocean waves, sea level, surface temperature, greenhouse gas concentrations, clouds, rain, severe storms, sun spot activity, and sediment layers; and weather-correlated epidemiological studies.

Some Chinese are seeking links between El Nino and sunspot cycles. Global warming and sunspot activity have been linked to El Nino. Scientific technologies and techniques for studying these phenomena include: computer modeling, simulation and forecasting of global climate and weather; onsite and remote satellite measurement of changes in weather data, deep ocean waves, sea level, surface temperature, greenhouse gas concentrations, clouds, rain, severe storms, sun spot activity, and sediment layers; and weather-correlated epidemiological studies.
It can cause storms in California, tornadoes in Florida, a mild winter in the northern states, and reduce the number of Atlantic hurricanes. On the positive side, El Nino can be credited with saving lives that would have been lost in normal winter and hurricane seasons.
Its effects on mortality and the economy are mixed. El Nino and El Nina are opposite extremes of continuous but far ranging changes in water surface temperature, precipitation, trade winds, and sea level in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, which portend extreme changes and reversals in usual global climate and weather patterns, resulting in dangerous temperature changes, storms, floods and droughts world wide, with severe economic impacts, disease and death.
In 1995 there were 4.4 million more low-income earners than there were low-cost housing units and the pool of affordable housing was shrinking. Low-income Americans face problems in finding housing because their numbers have increased over the last two decades while the pool of affordable housing has shrunk.
Landlords were dropping out of rent subsidy programs to raise the rent or convert the real estate to condominiums. Landlords have dropped out of subsidy programs or properties have been closed because of age or razed.
Wages haven't kept up with housing cost rises driven by a strong economy. Part of the problem is wage increases have failed to keep up with steep increases in rental rates. In addition, rents were going up faster than incomes.
No new U.S. federal housing assistance vouchers were created after 1994. Congress refused any new assistance vouchers between 1995-1998.
Using these vouchers to buy a home became possible in 2000. Real or proposed measures include block grants to states for housing assistance, greater availability of rent subsidies and federally insured mortgages, use of rent vouchers to help buy a home, and incentives or requirements to keep landlords in subsidy programs and encourage the creation of subsidized housing units. Vouchers could be used to pay home mortgages.
Real estate investment trusts were being formed that specialized in affordable housing. Real Estate Investment Trusts specializing in affordable housing were established.
In 1997 at least 4.5 million families were paying more than 50% of their income on housing, up 12% since 1991. In 1997 5.4 million were paying more than 50% of income for housing.
Cuban-Americans in Miami protested vehemently and often for the boy to remain in the U.S. In Cuba, Elian's father demanded his return, and thousands of Cubans rallied to demand it. Elian's great-uncle in Florida was granted temporary custody, but his father demanded his return to Cuba. Fidel Castro and Elian's father Juan Miguel Gonzalez demanded Elian's return to Cuba.
The 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled for the government and Elian's father, later reaffirming its decision.

On June 1, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta ruled for the government and Elian's father.
His Miami relatives refused to meet with his father in Washington, and Attorney General Reno met with Gonzales relatives in an effort to end the stalemate. Reno met with the relatives and ordered them to surrender Elian.
Elian's Cuban grandmothers visited him in Florida in January and, in April, his father arrived in Washington. The drama intensified when the boy's father traveled to the U.S. on April 6.
On March 21, a U.S. District Judge dismissed Lazaro Gonzales' lawsuit. The relatives challenged the INS ruling, then appealed their suit's dismissal. He filed a federal lawsuit, which was dismissed in March, but Elian was enjoined from leaving the United States during the appeal process. Numerous court appeals by his Miami relatives to overturn the decision were denied.
The relatives challenged the INS ruling, then appealed their suit's dismissal. On January 19, Lazaro Gonzalez challenged the INS ruling.
Vietnam demanded Elian be returned to Cuba. On April 17, The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry demanded the U.S. end its Cuba embargo and honor the 1995 Immigration Agreement by returning to Cuba all illegal Cuban deportees.
His mother drowned when their boat capsized in her failed attempt to bring the child to freedom. He, his mother, and 12 others had fled Cuba in a motorboat that capsized. On November 22, 1999, 6-year old Elian Gonzales escaped Cuba by boat with his mother. On November 25, 1999, six-year-old Elian Gonzalez was rescued from the Atlantic after the boat in which he and his mother and others were fleeing Cuba for the US capsized and his mother drowned.
After a final appeal by the Miami relatives was denied and the court order blocking his return expired, Elian returned with his father to Cuba on June 28, 2000. Elian and his father returned to Cuba on a chartered plane that day, later meeting with Castro. On June 28, the Supreme Court rejected a final appeal; Elian returned home to Cuba, was celebrated in the media and returned to his home and schooling. Elian returned to Cuba on June 28, 2000.
Based on US and international law, the INS ruled that Elian belonged with his father and should be returned to Cuba. Federal immigration officials, however, ruled that Elian be returned to his father in Cuba. On January 5, 2000, the INS decided Elian "belongs with his father" back in Cuba. The great-uncle applied for asylum for Elian, but the Immigration and Naturalization Service, in accordance with US and international law, ruled that Elian belonged with his father and should be returned to Cuba.
Reno upheld the father's right to custody and ignored Florida court interference, stating immigration was a federal matter. On January 12, Reno upheld Elian's father's right to custody, telling the Florida courts they have no say in this federal matter.
On November 25, 2000, six-year-old Elian Gonzales was rescued at sea, found lashed to an inner tube, floating off the coast of Miami. On November 25, 1999, six-year-old Elian Gonzalez was rescued from the Atlantic after the boat in which he and his mother and others were fleeing Cuba for the US capsized and his mother drowned.

Former President Jimmy Carter has played an active role on the international stage. In the years since he left office, he has traveled extensively to monitor elections, conduct peace negotiations, and establish relief efforts.
The Center's delegations have observed elections in China (where Carter fosters his one-China policy), Indonesia, Nigeria, Liberia, and Mozambique. By 1999 he had monitored more than 20 elections in 16 countries including Nicaragua, Liberia, Nigeria, Venezuela, China (village and township committee elections), Indonesia, Mozambique, Peru, the Dominican Republic and Mexico.

In 1982, Carter established the Carter Center, a human rights organization based in Atlanta, Georgia. In addition, he and his wife, Rosalynn, established the Carter Center in 1982. In 1982, former US president Jimmy Carter and his wife founded the Carter Center, devoted to observing countries and furthering their democracy and development, human rights issues, and public health.
Since 1987 the Center has been committed to the eradication of river blindness in Africa. Since 1987, the Carter Center has worked to treat and prevent diseases causing blindness in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, including trachoma and river blindness. In 1999 the Center received grants totaling $30 million to expand programs for treatment and prevention of blindness in Africa and Latin America and to extend its anti-trachoma program from Mali to Sudan, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Niger, Ghana and Yemen.

Carter and the Carter Center contributed to the near global eradication of Guinea worm disease, a disease infesting more than 3 million people annually in tropical Africa, India, and Pakistan. In 1986 an estimated 3 million people were infested each year with this roundworm.
Since 1987, the Carter Center has worked to treat and prevent diseases causing blindness in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, including trachoma and river blindness. In 1999, the Center initiated its first program aimed at eradicating trachoma, another eye disease caused by black flies, which has blinded 6 million people and infected millions more.
He had monitored more than 20 elections in 16 countries.

Through the Carter Center, the former President has led successful campaigns against two devastating diseases: river blindness and Guineau worm disease. Since 1987, the Carter Center has worked to treat and prevent diseases causing blindness in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, including trachoma and river blindness. They also provided funds to fight river blindness, a disease that infects 18 million people mainly in Africa. Since 1987 the Center has been committed to the eradication of river blindness in Africa.
In 1982, former US president Jimmy Carter and his wife founded the Carter Center, devoted to observing countries and furthering their democracy and development, human rights issues, and public health. In addition, he and his wife, Rosalynn, established the Carter Center in 1982.
It was founded to battle racial bias and has expanded its efforts by tracking hate crimes and the increasing spread of racist organizations across the US. It tracks US hate crimes and the spread of racist organizations. The SPLC participates in tracking down hate groups and publicizing their activities in its Intelligence Report, teaching tolerance and bringing lawsuits against discriminatory practices and hate groups.
The law center's co-founder and chief trial counsel, Morris Dees, has successfully handled civil rights cases for more than 30 years--in 1973 his federal lawsuit had the practical effect of forcing funeral homes to provide equal services to blacks and whites. The SPLC influenced funeral homes to provide equal services to blacks and whites, tried to discourage the sale and distribution of the racist book The Turner Diaries, and protected Vietnamese fishermen from Klan intimidation. As early as 1973 the SPLC won a federal case which forced funeral homes throughout the U.S. to provide equal services to blacks and whites.
Dees and the SPLC seek to destroy hate groups through multi-million dollar civil suits that go after assets of groups and their leaders. He has used the civil lawsuit like a "Buck Knife, carving financial assets out of hate group leaders". As a white lawyer, Dees has been instrumental in crusading against racial intolerance by using lawsuits to destroy the finances of hate groups. Dees and the SPLC have fought to break the organizations by legal action resulting in severe financial penalties.
The SPLC also funds a three-year, $100,000 civil rights litigation program in Georgia designed to stem federal cutbacks in programs that provide free legal assistance to poor people in civil actions. It charges its clients nothing. However, Dees does not charge the groups and the Center estimates that it collects only 2% on successful judgments. It also funded a civil rights litigation program in Georgia to provide free legal assistance to poor people.
Described as "wielding the civil lawsuit like a Buck Knife, carving financial assets out of hate group leaders," the technique has been most impressive: 1987-$7 million against the United Klans of America in Mobile, Alabama; 1989-$1 million against Klan groups in Forsyth County, Georgia; 1990-$9 million against the White Aryan Resistance in Portland, Oregon; and 1998-$20 million against The Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Charleston, South Carolina. They successfully sued the Ku Klux Klan and the related Invisible Empire Klan, United Klan of America, and Christian Knights of the KKK; the White Aryan Resistance; and the Aryan Nations and its founder Richard Butler. Since 1979 he has won a series of six, countrywide civil rights suits against the Ku Klux Klan and other Neo-Nazi groups accused of criminal activity.
Nearly all money from settlements goes to the victims, with less than 2 percent going to the SPLC. However, Dees does not charge the groups and the Center estimates that it collects only 2% on successful judgments.
The SPLC participates in tracking down hate groups and publicizing their activities in its Intelligence Report, teaching tolerance and bringing lawsuits against discriminatory practices and hate groups. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a non-profit organization in Montgomery, Alabama, was founded in the 1970s to help minorities litigate against civil rights abuses. Dees has determined that the civil courts are an effective forum in which to attack and destroy hate groups.
Under that program, a magazine promoting interracial and intercultural understanding goes to more than 400,000 teachers. It freely distributes booklets on combating hate to schools, mayors, police chiefs, and other interested groups and citizens.
Morris Dees was co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) in 1971 and has served as its Chief Trial Counsel and Executive Director. Morris Dees co-founded the SPLC in 1971 and is its chief trial counsel and executive director, following Julian Bond. The law center's co-founder and chief trial counsel, Morris Dees, has successfully handled civil rights cases for more than 30 years--in 1973 his federal lawsuit had the practical effect of forcing funeral homes to provide equal services to blacks and whites. Morris Dees is a co-founder and leader of the Southern Poverty Law Center, located in Montgomery, Alabama.
By April 1996 a consultative group was in place to design the new currency and a year later a new currency code was issued to facilitate technical preparations. Design of the euro note began in 1996. Euro design development began in 1996.
In 1998 the test printing of banknotes began and Germany minted some euro coins. Germany was preparing to do so. By the end of the year Germany was still experimenting with euro coins but France was in full production followed by Finland, Belgium and Spain.
In May 1998 two major banks began quoting prices in euros. The announcement by two banks in May 1998 that they would quote prices in euro seven months before its official adoption demonstrated the acceptance of the euro by financial markets. Signs of the euro's acceptance included: two international banks quoting prices in the euro; China welcoming its initiation; Eurostat offering euro-related information online; Bulgaria moving to link its currency with the euro; and Thailand considering using it in foreign reserves.
Prior to the scheduled introduction of the euro, polls indicated most EU citizens were in favor and believe it will be successful. Polls indicate support but widespread skepticism remains.
Despite media skepticism, the European Commission maintained it would be introduced on schedule January 1, 1999, initially for cashless trading. The euro was to be used in cashless trading as of January 1, 1999, but the actual currency was not to go into use until January 1, 2002, with present currencies' ceasing to be legal tender six months later. Initial transactions will be cashless.
Bank notes and coins will become legal tender January 1st 2002 while national currencies will stop circulating by July 1st 2002.

Environmentalists, Aboriginal landowners and opposition parties condemned the decision out of concern for Kakadu's environmental and cultural value. Opposition parties, conservationists and local Mirrar Aboriginal people opposed the mine despite ERA assurances that it wouldn't adversely affect the area.
In October 1997, the Australian government gave permission to Energy Resources of Australia (ERA) to open the Jabiluka uranium mine on the edge of the Kakadu National Park which is on the World Heritage List, in Australia's Northern Territory. The conservative Australian government of Prime Minister John Howard gave its approval in 1997 for the development of the Jabiluka uranium mine. In 1996, following a decade of opposing new uranium mines, the Australian Government approved construction of the Jabiluka mine in the Kakadu National Park. In 1996, Energy Resources Australia (ERA) requested approval for the Jabiluka uranium mine on the edge of the Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory.

A UNESCO World Heritage Bureau delegation visited the area in October 1998 and concluded the Jabiluka mine would pose a severe danger to the cultural and natural values of the adjacent Kakadu National Park. A team from the United Nations World Heritage Bureau visited the site, then called for closing the Jabiluka mine because it poses a danger to the cultural and natural values of the Kakadu Park. Shortly after construction began in mid June 1998, there were a series of public protests.
Its report raised the prospect of Kakadu being placed on the committee's endangered list. If they were unsatisfactory the committee would recommend Kakadu's inclusion on the endangered list. The report recommended the Kakadu World Heritage Area be declared endangered.
Protesters campaigned against the mine and 350 were arrested. Police reported hundreds of arrests as protesters blockaded the site, firebombed an ERA office, and infiltrated an ERA general meeting.

In October 1997, the Australian government gave permission to Energy Resources of Australia (ERA) to open the Jabiluka uranium mine on the edge of the Kakadu National Park which is on the World Heritage List, in Australia's Northern Territory. In 1996, following a decade of opposing new uranium mines, the Australian Government approved construction of the Jabiluka mine in the Kakadu National Park.
The government defended its decision saying the mine would generate millions of revenue dollars and create 2,000 jobs. The mine is expected to produce 19.5 million tons of ore and generate 4.46 billion U.S. dollars to Australia's GNP over 28 years. ERA's second uranium mine in the area would generate billions of US dollars in revenue and create 2,000 jobs.

The Sharm El Sheikh agreement would mediate final-status agreements by September 1999 on Jerusalem, Palestinian borders, Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, water, and complete Israeli redeployment from West Bank except military zones and Jewish settlements. In attempts to salvage the principles of the Oslo accords, new agreements were signed in 1998 by Netanyahu and Arafat at the Wye Plantaion outside Washington, D.C. and in September 1999 at Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt outlining a framework for a final-status peace accord by September 2000.
As of late 2000, the Oslo terms were far from implemented with about 40 percent of the West Bank returned to full or partial Palestinian control. Modification of the Oslo accords was followed by some progress in the Wye Plantation peace agreement in October 1998, but by June 2000 as the Palestinians and Israelis embarked on final status talks, Israel had handed over control of only 40% of the West Bank.
The Accords were based on the principle of land to the Palestinians in exchange for peace for the Israelis. The 1993 "Oslo Accords," signed by Israeli president Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, were based on the principles of "Land for Peace" and "Palestinian self-rule". The 1993 Oslo Accords established the principles of "land for peace" and "security and reciprocity" leading to Palestinian self-rule by May 4, 1999.
The accords called for Palestinian self-rule in most of Gaza and the West Bank and for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from these territories.

Israel would redeploy from 80 percent of Hebron by March 1996; from rural West Bank by September 1997, leaving full control to the Palestinian National Authority, opening safe passages between West Bank and Gaza, and lifting closure on Palestinian areas, if Palestinians would abrogate their Charter's article to destroy Israel. The Oslo Accord of 1993 stipulated that the Israeli Army would pull back from 80% of Hebron in the West Bank by March 28, 1996. Under the accords, Israel should have completed its pullout from the West Bank town of Hebron in March 1996, but a series of suicide bombing attacks in February delayed the pullout.
A second phase of Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank was to be completed by September 1997. Israel would redeploy from 80 percent of Hebron by March 1996; from rural West Bank by September 1997, leaving full control to the Palestinian National Authority, opening safe passages between West Bank and Gaza, and lifting closure on Palestinian areas, if Palestinians would abrogate their Charter's article to destroy Israel.
Under the accords, Israel should have completed its pullout from the West Bank town of Hebron in March 1996, but a series of suicide bombing attacks in February delayed the pullout. Two factors impeding implementation were the ascent to power in 1996 of the conservative Likud government led by Benjamin Netanyahu and a series of deadly suicide bombings sponsored by Hamas the same year. The first Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank was delayed after a series of suicide bombing attacks, and again pending the Israeli elections.

By 1997 Israel's new settlements, land confiscation, delayed redeployments and Palestinian attacks halted implementation. After the ascent of Netanyahu as Israeli Prime Minister, progress stalled in the face of vigorous Israeli settlement in the West Bank in defiance of the Oslo accords. Israel began building more settlements in the occupied territories, delayed troop redeployments in the West Bank, and tightened control over Jerusalem, These policies, together with Hamas terrorist attacks, derailed the peace process and stalemated peace talks. Israel abandoned the Labor Party's freeze on new settlements and delayed redeployment of its forces in the West Bank, saying the Palestinians were not doing enough to combat terrorism and that more Israelis had died since the Oslo accords than in the 15 years before.

In attempting to get his client a life sentence rather than the death penalty, Tangeman argued that McKinney's past, which included sexual abuse as a child, caused him to lash out in rage at Shepard's sexual advances. At trial in October, McKinney's attorney pleaded that McKinney committed manslaughter because of "gay panic" to homosexual advances from Shepard, because McKinney had been abused homosexually at age 7 and had consensual homosexual sex at 15.
By 1999 more than half of US "citizens" were chronically overweight (body mass index 25) and 22% were obese (BMI 30 or more), up from 12.5% in 1991. Over half of Americans are overweight.
The entire US population could be overweight in a few generations. At the current rate, everyone in America will be obese by 2030. If this trend continues all Americans will be obese by 2030.
One third of American adults are obese. Studies found 20-33% of adults and 15% of children obese and one study placed the figure for Americans as a whole at 17.9%. In 1998 studies found 1 in 3 or 4 Americans obese.
In 1999 45 US states had 15 percent or higher percent obesity rates compared to four states in 1991. Forty-five states have obesity rates over 15%. In 1991 only 4 states had a rating greater than 15% while in 1999 45 states reached that level.
Approximately 300,000 deaths a year are attributed to this obesity epidemic. Obesity in the U.S., the fattest nation on earth, is an epidemic costing the healthcare system 50 billion dollars and causing 300,000 deaths annually.
A 1999 survey in Los Angeles county found that 55% of men and 39% of women are overweight; African-Americans have the highest rate of obesity at 58%, Latinos 44%, whites 44% and Asian-Americans the lowest, 25%. Obesity increased faster among 18-29 year olds, college educated people, Hispanics, and African Americans than the general population. 58% of African-Americans were in the group with 54% of Latinos and 44% of whites.
The number of obese children doubled in 20 years. The number of obese children doubled in the same time.
The number of overweight Californians jumped 50% between 1984 and 1997. Californians saw a 50 percent jump in obesity in two decades while Georgia saw a 102 percent jump in two decades.
US obesity is due to sedentary lifestyles and readily-available "super-sized" calorie-and-fat rich foods. The reasons for U.S. obesity are in our culture of abundance and inactivity. Environmental causes include a sedentary lifestyle and an increase in the amounts and types of food consumed. More generally, the cause is a culture of abundance and inactivity.
Populations gain weight as they abandon traditional lower-calorie diets for prosperous modern diets with more calories. Specific examples of this mix are over-promotion and over-consumption of huge servings of fast food, lack of sidewalks and exercise facilities ad too much television.

A weak angiogenesis inhibitor, interferon blocks a substance secreted by some tumors that signals the body to grow more cells. It is antiviral and a weak angiogenesis inhibitor.
It is proving effective in the treatment of liver diseases hepatitis C and hepatitis B, multiple sclerosis, and life-threatening tumors. It has been used most prominently either alone or in combination with ribavirin to treat liver disease, particularly hepatitis B and hepatitis C, but has also been effective in stopping the growth of giant-cell tumors. For many years, Interferon was the only approved drug for the treatment of hepatitis C. Its long-term effectiveness was from 20-40% for patients treated for six months. It is used to treat hepatitis, multiple sclerosis, and cancer.
It is in the early stages of study in the treatment of cancer with some promising results. Interferon alpha-2b is used to treat viral diseases, including Ebola, and is also used to treat some cancer. It is used to treat hepatitis, multiple sclerosis, and cancer.
It is proving effective in the treatment of liver diseases hepatitis C and hepatitis B, multiple sclerosis, and life-threatening tumors. On the positive side, it has saved the lives of many children with life-threatening tumors called hemangiomas for which no other cancer treatment had worked. Interferon has also saved many children with life threatening growths, called hemangiomas by its ability to knock out a tumor's ability to recruit blood vessels from nearby tissues.
In hepatitis C, interferon suppresses the virus to undetectable levels (absent from the blood and reduced liver inflammation) in 5 percent of patients and reduces symptoms in 10-20 percent.

Interferon may produce flu-like side effects like fever and lethargy, and perhaps depression. Patients complain that flu symptoms, lethargy, clogged saliva glands, chronic yeast infection, urinary infection and depression can often make the treatment almost as devastating as the disease. Interferon is known to produce flu-like side effects.

Interferon is a protein isolated from human cells. A genetic engineering drug, interferon, has been developed from protein isolated from human cells.
It eliminates the disease in only 10-20% of patients and about half of those treated do not respond at all. Interferon alone eliminates hepatitis C in about 10-20 percent of patients, about 50 percent do not respond, while the remaining 30-40 percent respond and then relapse.
Until recently, it was the only treatment for hepatitis but now there is a new treatment approach involving combinations of interferon and ribavirin. For many years, Interferon was the only approved drug for the treatment of hepatitis C. Its long-term effectiveness was from 20-40% for patients treated for six months.
Studies show that after six months all signs of the virus were gone in 82 percent of those on the combination compared with half on interferon alone. A frequent hepatitis C treatment is by Rebetron, a combination of interferon injections and ribavirin capsules, which eliminates hepatitis C symptoms in twice as many patients as interferon alone. A more effective treatment for hepatitis C was to use the drug ribavarin in combination with Interferon.
Interferon has also saved many children with life threatening growths, called hemangiomas by its ability to knock out a tumor's ability to recruit blood vessels from nearby tissues. On the positive side, it has saved the lives of many children with life-threatening tumors called hemangiomas for which no other cancer treatment had worked.
However, the side effects of Rebetron's added ribavirin can include difficulty breathing, sore throat, rashes, itching, nausea, insomnia, anorexia, sudden anemia, heart attack, stroke, birth defects, and psychiatric problems like depression and suicidal behavior. The drug combination can cause breathing difficulty, sore throat, rashes, itching, nausea, insomnia, anemia, anorexia and occasionally birth defects.

In searching for Rudolph the government conducted one of the most extensive manhunts in recent history. About 200 FBI, state, and local officials began searching the remote densely forested area employing helicopters, dogs, and survival-training volunteers. The search scoured the Nantahala National Forest in North Carolina where Rudolph lived as a boy.
Six months later, Rudolph was identified by a food store owner near Nantahale Lake in Western North Carolina not far from where he first lived. He was known to be an outdoorsman and survivalist and was hiding in familiar woods near his childhood home. Rudolph is believed to be hiding in the 530,000-acre Nantahala National Forest, a rugged area in western North Carolina, which is near Rudolph's home.

The Line-Item Veto Act was overturned by U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in April 1997 and later ruled 6-3 as unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court because it allows the president to alter a law after passage, thereby creating a new law not voted on by either house of Congress. The Court vote was 6-3 with Justice Stevens writing for the majority. On June 25, 1998 after lower courts rejected the Line Item Veto Act as unconstitutional, on appeal by the White House the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that Congress unconstitutionally violated the principle of separation of powers, because that procedure allows the president to create a law that was not voted on by either house of Congress in violation of the Constitution's Article I "presentment" clause.
He used it 163 times, mostly to delete items from the military construction bill. In October 1997 Congress overrode the president's line-item veto against 36 of 38 military construction projects. The affected items were projects for specific localities, many in the area of military construction, which had been added to the president's budget by Congress. President Clinton used the authority to veto 82 items in 11 bills, including money for New York hospitals, a tax break for Idaho potato growers, 38 projects worth $287M in military construction, $144M from a defense spending bill and $30M for intercepting asteroids.
It was considered in line with the historic relationship between Congress and the president and would provide a tool for eliminating wasteful pork barrel spending while enlivening debate over the best use of funds. The line-item veto (LIV) has been sought by nearly every president this century as a tool to limit pork barrel spending which is traditionally reviled as the most cynically deployed and least utilitarian form of largess.
The first court ruling on the LIV act was in U.S. District Court when in February 1998 it was ruled unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated the separation of powers. On June 25, 1998 after lower courts rejected the Line Item Veto Act as unconstitutional, on appeal by the White House the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that Congress unconstitutionally violated the principle of separation of powers, because that procedure allows the president to create a law that was not voted on by either house of Congress in violation of the Constitution's Article I "presentment" clause.
A Republican-controlled Congress passed the Line-Item Veto Act which went into effect January 1997. In January 1997, the first year of the law, the president vetoed 163 line-items in six bills, and in 1998 82 line-items in 11 bills.
The line item veto has been sought by presidents since Grant and was popularized by Reagan. The line-item veto (LIV) has been sought by nearly every president this century as a tool to limit pork barrel spending which is traditionally reviled as the most cynically deployed and least utilitarian form of largess.
In 1996 a Republican congress overwhelmingly passed a Line Item Veto Act allowing presidents (including the incumbent Democratic president), to strike individual tax or spending items within 5 days after signing a bill into law. A Republican-controlled Congress passed the Line-Item Veto Act which went into effect January 1997. Congress passed a law authorizing the line item veto (LIV) in 1996 accepting arguments that the measure would help preserve the integrity of federal spending by allowing the president to strike unnecessary spending and tax items from legislation thus encouraging the government to live within its means. It was part of Republican "Contract with America" led by Speaker Newt Gingrich that enacted it.
President Clinton used the authority to veto 82 items in 11 bills, including money for New York hospitals, a tax break for Idaho potato growers, 38 projects worth $287M in military construction, $144M from a defense spending bill and $30M for intercepting asteroids. President Clinton exercised the LIV on 82 items in 1997 saving $1.9 billion in spending projected over five years. In January 1997, the first year of the law, the president vetoed 163 line-items in six bills, and in 1998 82 line-items in 11 bills.
On June 25, 1998 after lower courts rejected the Line Item Veto Act as unconstitutional, on appeal by the White House the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that Congress unconstitutionally violated the principle of separation of powers, because that procedure allows the president to create a law that was not voted on by either house of Congress in violation of the Constitution's Article I "presentment" clause. The Department of Justice appealed that decision and in June 1998 the Supreme Court ruled the LIV act unconstitutional but on the grounds that it violated Article I, 7, Clause 2 (The "presentment clause") of the Constitution that establishes the process by which a bill becomes law. The Justice Department appealed that decision to the Supreme Court.
Acupuncture has also been used for cosmetic therapy, addictions, weight problems, bedwetting, and acne. NIH's list of potential successful acupuncture applications included addiction, rehabilitation after stroke, headaches, menstrual cramps, myofascial pain, back pain, osteoarthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, and fibromyalgia. The committee's unprecedented report acknowledged acupuncture as an effective or promising treatment for a variety of ailments including: muscle pain, asthma, adult post-operative and chemotherapy nausea, post-operative dental pain, addiction, stroke rehabilitation, headache, menstrual cramps, morning sickness, tennis elbow, fibromyalgia, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Among the ailments for which acupuncture could be used were low backpain, asthma, post-operative and chemotherapy nausea, drug and other addictions, stroke rehabilitation, fibromyalgia, and carpal tunnel syndrome.
Following the endorsement by NIH, acupuncture, especially for pain management, became more common in the US. As acupuncture is becoming more common, many Americans believe that health maintenance organizations should cover the ancient Chinese therapy; and, while insurers have typically refused to pay for alternative therapies in the past, they are realizing they can save money reimbursing for unconventional treatment versus a costly, traditional approach such as surgery.
Acupuncture offers the advantages of fewer side effects, relatively lower cost, and usability with pregnant women. An NIH panel added that it should be included in any comprehensive treatment for certain conditions and noted that it has few side effects.
A recent survey found that almost two thirds of traditional US medical schools now teach alternative therapies, including chiropractic, acupuncture, herbal remedies and mind-body medicine. Most medical schools now teach alternative therapies including acupuncture and Health Maintenance Organizations have started to pay for this form of therapy, especially for pain management. Two thirds of US medical schools teach acupuncture.
With a history of more than 2000 years, acupuncture is a major part of an Asian tradition of medicine. Acupuncture is the ancient Chinese medical therapy technique of inserting thin, sharpened needles into specific nerve junction points of the body.
Acupuncture was also being used to treat apoplexy, high blood pressure, weight problems, bedwetting, and infertility; and for cosmetic surgery for face lifts and to remove lines around the eyes and wrinkles about the mouth. Acupuncture has also been used for cosmetic therapy, addictions, weight problems, bedwetting, and acne.

From there the team flew east across Asia, over the Pacific for six days to Mexico, then across the Atlantic to complete the final leg of their journey.
After weeks of delays trying to get fly-over permission from China, Piccard and British balloonist Brian Jones took off from Chateau d'Oex in the Swiss Alps on March 1, 1999 for a third attempt. Piccard had made two previous attempts at the feat in 1997 and 1998 with two differing teams--the first was abandoned after only six hours aloft because of a hazardous fuel leak; the second attempt was aborted after the balloon was denied permission to fly through China's airspace. Swiss balloonist Bertand Piccard was forced to abandon his first attempt to circumnavigate the world non-stop in a balloon six hours after take-off because of a fuel leak, January 12, 1997. Swiss psychiatrist Bertrand Piccard, from a family of explorers, made three attempts at the first balloon circumnavigation of the earth.
The pilots were worried that they might not have enough fuel to reach the finish line, but found favorable winds to carry them across the Atlantic. They picked up another jet stream, and on March 19, beat the endurance record set just two weeks before.
Piccard and Jones piloted their innovative, helium/hot-air hybrid balloon-- the Breitling Orbiter 3--by controlling the craft's rising and falling in order to catch the winds (typically jet streams) that seemed to be going in the most promising direction; satellite communication, navigation, and weather monitoring systems kept them in touch with their control centers, and provided guidance essential to success and survival. The successful Breitling Orbiter III was a 180-foot-high Rozier balloon with separate helium and air bags and a pressurized capsule.
They spent a final night flying across Africa before landing in the Sahara some 300 miles south of Cairo.
