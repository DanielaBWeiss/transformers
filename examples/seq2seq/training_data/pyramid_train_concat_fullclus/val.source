As early as December, 1992, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, of GM, was in touch with Ferdinand Piech, Chairman of Volkeswagen, about coming to work for VW. He was presumably recruited by VW chairman, Ferdinand Piech, who was impressed with Lopez's leading role in helping Adam Opel recover from a major production cost disadvantage. Ferdinand Piech had just been installed as Chairman of Volkswagen when he hired Lopez. VW chairman Ferdinand Piech recruited the General Motors/Opel executive, Jose Lopez de Arriortua. Ferdinand Piech became Volkswagen chairman in January 1993 and planned to turn the money-losing company around. European government and industry leaders expressed fear that defensive allegations by VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech, that the Lopez incident amounted to U.S. industrial warfare against Germany, would destabilize U.S.-European commercial and diplomatic relations.
European government and industry leaders expressed fear that defensive allegations by VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech, that the Lopez incident amounted to U.S. industrial warfare against Germany, would destabilize U.S.-European commercial and diplomatic relations. This angered GM and led Germany to distance itself from Piech's damaging nationalistic tones.
The two countries planned to develop oil resources in the South Atlantic jointly. In January, 1994, the British indicated readiness to allow Argentine companies to take part in the development of oilfields in the Falkland Islands' territorial waters, provided they acknowledged that any oil extracted belonged to Britain. British Gas and YPF, Argentina's state-owned oil company, began negotiating jointly exploring offshore gas and oilfields bordering the Falkland Islands in April, 1993. In February 1992, both countries began discussions in Buenos Aires on developing South Atlantic oil resources.
An international tribunal to judge war crimes in the former Yugoslavia has been proposed and would sit in the Hague where the World Court is located. The Court may also appoint an independent tribunal such as the international war crimes tribunal in 1991, charged with attempting to prosecute perpetrators of murder, rape, and enforced expulsions in former Yugoslavia. In the early 1990's, the Court also hosted the UN sponsored international war crimes tribunal, trying those accused of murder and other atrocities in the former Yugoslavia. It provided a venue for the UN-sponsored Yugoslav war crimes tribunal in 1993. The UN Security Council convened an International War Crimes Tribunal to be held at The Hague, where the International Court of Justice is located.
Companies are learning to concentrate only on innovative drugs that seem certain to prove effective and to drop research on those taking too long to develop. "Me-too" drugs similar to what is already on the market are developed only where there is a market advantage from improved safety, effectiveness or treatment cost-benefit.
Hospital nurses were arrested in Austria for killing patients, some of whom were not terminally ill, with lethal injections. Active mercy killings include Philip Lee Saylor who shot his AIDS-suffering friend Steven Charles Jenkins; Roswell Gilbert who shot his Alzheimer-suffering wife Emily; a man who shot his fatally lion-mauled friend; British doctor Alan Cox who gave an elderly patient a heart-stopping injection; Delbert Ward who suffocated his ill brother William in his sleep; and three Austrian nurses and West German nurse Michaela Roeder who gave patients lethal injections. Three nurses in a Vienna hospital were arrested in1989, under suspicion of killing up to 35 patients with drug overdoses. Illegal medical killings include one by a British doctor, 35 killed by Austrian nurses, and six killed by German Michaela Roeder.
These include sustainable forestry (using reforestation and leaving surrounding areas intact), the creation of environmental zones to protect species, eco-businesses finding markets for the renewable resources, less intrusive mining methods, and improved government enforcement of laws and patrols of park. Brazilian programs to reduce deforestation and CO2 emission, and promote sustainable development include "extractive reserves" which globally market renewable "rain-forest chic" products (replenishable trees, produce, nuts, latex, pharmaceutical plants); discontinuing subsidies to clear-cutting for unsustainable ranches which dislocated forest people; tree improvement; pesticide controls; minimizing roads and mineral mining impacts; increasing fish pond farming; and improving law enforcement. Cultural Survival, a US foundation, tries to find buyers for these products. Additionally, "extractive reserves" are being developed wherein traditional populations can carry out harvesting of traditional products with the aid of processing facilities and the creation of overseas marketing.
Namely, the slash and burn cycles by ranchers, farmers, loggers, and miners depletes the soil making it impossible to replenish the forest, causes erosion leading to floods or clogging of streams and rivers, or pollutes the water and the air which endangers humans, animals and plant life. Deforestation is the greatest problem for the rainforest environment and is brought about by logging for valuable hardwood timber, by land stripping for farming and cattle raising, and by road building for access to mining and oil exploration areas. The rainforest suffers great losses from wide scale logging, illegal logging, illegal mining, chaotic development, roadway construction, and hydroelectric projects. The Amazon rain forest was heavily damaged by deforestation from increasing logging, cattle ranching, farming, mining, roadways, and hydroelectric projects.
Other breeds which assist law enforcement include Airedale-Belgian malinois mixes, Rottweilers, beagles, English cocker spaniels, beagle-spaniel mixes, and mongrels. Several dog breeds are used in law enforcement world-wide. The breeds of dogs most commonly used in law enforcement are German Shepherds brought to the US from Germany, Belgian malinois, and Labrador retrievers. Other dogs used in police work are: Alsatians, Rottweilers, English Cocker Spaniels, and various mixes of pit bulls and beagles. Others include Belgian Malinoise, Labradors, Alsatians, Rottweillers, beagles, and airdailes.
The tasks performed by dogs include searching passengers, vehicles, aircraft, ships and cargo for bombs, drugs and agricultural contraband at borders, ports, and airports, as well as at crime scenes or on regular patrol. They are used by border patrol officers and customs officials to sniff out evidence of drugs aboard ships, airplanes, trains, trucks, and automobiles. They therefore are used to search anywhere they are needed, including crime scenes, fires, border crossings, vehicles, airplanes, airports, and boats. The US Customs Service also uses dogs to inspect boats for the same things.
The successful lowering of birth rates in countries such as China, India, Iran, Tunisia, Egypt, and Brazil are worth noting. Countries which have seen birth rates decline include Egypt, China, India, Tunisia, and Brazil. Yet, the serious economic disadvantages to nations and individuals of over-population have driven Islamic Iran, Egypt, Albania, Tunisia (which abolished polygamy), and largely Catholic Spain, Italy, Mexico, Brazil and other Latin American countries to remove government subsidies encouraging large families, start family planning (particularly contraception); women's health and education; and women's emancipation and employment efforts, to reduce fertility rates, as have the U.K., Germany, India, China, Mauritius, the Philippines, Zimbabwe and Botswana.
Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, stepped up its campaign for equal rights to Welsh self-determination, demanding equal constitutional treatment with Northern Ireland, and Scotland. Those who speak the language support Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party whose policy is to bypass an assembly and go for an independent Wales within the European community. Conservatives were strongly opposed, and the policy of Plaid Cymru, the nationalist party, was to bypass an assembly and go directly for independence within the European community. At that time, the Welsh Nationalist Party, Plaid Cymru, launched its manifesto urging self-government for Wales within the European Community (EU) noting that it was not just a distant aim but an urgent necessity and essential for democracy. From before 1992 through 1994 the UK's Tory Prime Minister adamantly resisted calls by MPs of the miniscule Wales Nationalist Party (Plaid Cymru) for devolution of British rule to a fully self-governing Wales within the European Community. The most outspoken group for separation is the Welsh nationalist party, Plaid Cymru, led by Dafydd Wigley. Plaid Cymru, the nationalist party of Wales, called for a Welsh parliament and wanted full self-government for Wales within the European Community.
The British PM has affirmed that "England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland together are far, far greater than the sum of their parts". The PM argued forcefully to preserve the union of England, Scotland and Wales.
Research shows the young women at coed colleges tend to defer to the men in intellectual debate. Some single-sex education supporters say that in coeducational schools women tend to defer to men in intellectual debate. This was attributed to girls' tendency toward "lack of self-confidence" and deference to boy's in the classroom, even in the presence of under-performing but uninhibited boys, who typically do not mature and begin to study diligently until after age 17 or 18. They may feel freer to take "traditional male" studies and do not feel forced to defer to the boys as they can feel in coeducational classes.
Life on most Indian reservations is marked by extreme poverty, drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, failed education, rising crime rates and high unemployment. Indian communities have greater than average occurrences of such problems as drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, teen pregnancy, poor education, and unemployment.
Exercise, weight loss, support groups, and self-help courses also have been found to reduce osteoarthritis pain. Researchers are also looking at an antibiotic doxycycline and vitamins C and E. There is general agreement that sufferers from arthritis benefit from weight loss and exercise. Treatment can involve medicines, surgery, and nontraditional approaches, as well as exercise and weight control. Weight loss and exercise are recommended.
According to evolutionists, scientific evidence shows that life began almost 4 million years ago with simple organisms, from which humans and all other forms of life evolved gradually over millions of years. Evolution science holds that the Earth is billions of years old, and that all species, including humans, arose over millions of years through genetic mutations and natural selection from a few initial life forms.
Russia used these incidents as an excuse to invade Chechnya, and mounted aerial and artillery attacks against rebel positions. In August 1998, Russia launched a massive anti-terrorist military campaign in Chechnya after separatists invaded the neighboring republic of Dagestan and carried out a series of incursions and explosions claiming the lives of over 300 people in several Russian cities, including Moscow. Russia began its military operations inside Chechnya in late September after Chechen rebels' armed incursions into neighboring Dagestan and a spate of terrorist acts in Russian cities that killed over 300.
Stephen's parents filed law suits against the five suspects and the Metropolitan Police over the failed investigation on the sixth anniversary of his killing. In April 1999, Lawrence's parents initiated a new civil action against all five suspects.
Critics say that doctors are too quick to diagnose ADHD and over-prescribe drugs for children. Because of the inexactness of early diagnoses, some medical personnel, parents, and educators think that ADHD is being over diagnosed. However, problems still exist: undesirable side effects, abusive use and theft of Ritalin for psychic effects, over diagnosing and over prescribing, and accusations of parental neglect by failing to give the prescribed medication to their children.

By 1998, Germany's Bundesbank announces that private investors will benefit from it. In early 1996 many EU countries continued to fear that the Euro would cause them to loose financial sovereignty; however, by late 1997 Germany was encouraging its companies and investors to welcome the Euro, stressing that it would expand investment opportunities, reduce currency risks, and increase competition. Technical preparations continued and although most German companies were not yet ready for the change, the Bundesbank predicted in early 1998 that private investors would benefit.
Late in 1998, Romania's Central Bank is to include the euro in posted hard currency exchange rates and perform services in the euro. Romania's Central Bank decided to include the Euro in their exchange rates while Bulgaria decided to formally back their lev by Euros. At the end of 1998 Romania's Central Bank saw serious problems ahead with the euro, but included it in its posted rates of exchange.
The Vatican, San Marino and Monaco are entitled to use the Euro as their official currency but cannot issue any currency unless they agree to EU conditions. Meanwhile such small independent countries as Monaco were left subject to special arrangements and conditions imposed by the European Union.
The military State Law and Order Restoration Council that seized power in 1988 and commits widespread ethnic cleansing and rape, has for 8 years prevented Parliament from convening. The NLD party, led by Suu Kyi, won the 1990 elections, but the junta won't honor election results. The National League for Democracy (NLD) party won 82 percent of the 1990 vote but the military annulled the election.
In 1990 the National League for Democracy lead by Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi won an 82% parliamentary majority in Myanmar (formerly Burma). After crushing a nationwide democracy movement, the State Law and Order Restoration Council took over Burma in 1998 and changed its name to Myanmar. The military took over in 1962, then the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) in 1988, massacring thousands and renaming Burma "Myanmar".
UNESCO's World Heritage Bureau gave the Australian government until April 15, 1999 to provide a comprehensive rebuttal to its report declaring Kakadu National Park endangered by the Jabiluka uranium mine. In November 1998, the U.N.World Heritage Bureau, after intense lobbying by the Australian government, decided not to put the Kakadu National Park on its endangered list, but asked for a detailed report by April 15th 1999 on what has been done to prevent further damage and mitigate all threats to the Kakadu park by the Jabiluka mine. The committee ordered Australian authorities to reveal actions taken to mitigate threats posed by the mine. After intense lobbying efforts from the Australian government not to put the park on the endangered list, the committee instead ordered Australian authorities to provide a report detailing what is being done to prevent damage to the park.
Australia's rebuttal cited errors of science, law and logic, and declared UNESCO's findings inconsistent with the fact that another nearby mine has operated for 20 years without adverse impact. Environment Minister Robert Hill said the UNESCO report was made after just a four day visit to the area and ignored a large volume of evidence gathered over 18 years of mining at the nearby Ranger mine. The Australian Government criticized the UN committee's report on the Kakadu National Park, calling it biased and unbalanced. Australian Environment Minister Robert Hill attacked the UN report, describing is as biased and containing errors of science.
Matthew Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming student, died after being in a coma for five days. Matthew Shepard, a gay 21-year old student at the University of Wyoming was kidnapped, savagely bludgeoned and left lashed to a fence in freezing weather. He had been robbed, beaten, and left to die on a fence outside of Laramie, Wyoming. On October 12, 1998 gay Wyoming University student Matthew Shepard, 21, died after being kidnapped, pistol-whipped and tied to a fence in near-freezing temperatures outside Laramie, Wyoming, by Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 22.
In attempting to get his client a life sentence rather than the death penalty, he argued that McKinney's past, which included sexual abuse as a child, caused him to lash out in rage at Shepard's sexual advances. They argued he had been an earlier victim of sexual abuse and on the night of the attack was affected by alcohol and methamphetamines. His defense attorneys maintained that Aaron's judgement on the night of the murder was affected by alcohol, methamphetamines and sexually traumatic events in his life which caused him to react in a moment of rage or "gay panic." The prosecution countered by saying there could not be a conspiracy of two people who pretend to be homosexuals, commit a robbery and murder, then claim homosexual panic. At McKinney's trial in October, McKinney's attorney pleaded that McKinney committed manslaughter in five minutes of "gay panic" to a sexual advance from Shepard, because drug and alcohol addicted McKinney had been abused homosexually at age 7 and had consensual homosexual sex at 15.
The final divorce settlement was signed on April 3, 2000 and a judge was asked to seal the agreement keeping it out of the public court file so its terms were likely to remain secret.

On January 12, 1997, a Swiss/Belgian team took off from the Swiss Alps in a bid to balloon non-stop around the world. Bertrand Piccard and Wim Verstraeten attempted the first balloon circumnavigation of the earth in January 1997 aboard the Breitling Orbiter, leaving from Lake Geneva. So far he has made three attempts, taking off from a mountain in the Swiss Alps near Lake Geneva with different crewmembers. For his second attempt, Piccard departed Switzerland January 28, 1998.
They gained vital time by obtaining flight permission from China before taking off. Piccard got Chinese airspace clearance before starting but was limited to a narrow strip, forbidden north of the 26th parallel. Having gotten permission before their departure, they passed over southern China.
The two men also received a $1 million prize from the Anheuser-Busch Corporation, half of which was to be donated to charity. As the first people to circumnavigate the Earth in a hot-air balloon, the two achieved what promoters said was the last great milestone of aviation and received awards from the International Olympic Committee and the Federation Aeronautique Internationale, as well as a $1 million prize from Anheuser-Bush Co. For their feat, Anheuser-Busch Corporation awarded the balloonists a cup and $1million prize money, some of which they will use to start the Winds of Hope Foundation charity.
After 19 days, 21 hours and 47 minutes aloft, the Swiss-British balloonist team of Piccard and Jones landed early on March 21 in the Saharan sands of southern Egypt.

Membership was not under consideration, however. Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), had been asking for three decades to join the European Union (EU). Its demand was turned away by the EU in 1997, which led to a deterioration of bilateral relations. In early 1997 the EU deferred considering EU membership for Turkey, some saying Turkey is an Asian nation, not European, despite U.S. endorsement of EU membership for Turkey as a European country.
In 1996, Energy Resources Australia (ERA) requested approval for the Jabiluka uranium mine on the edge of the Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory.

Four years ago, a ship seized in Singapore carried over 6 tons of elephant ivory, the largest shipment of the contraband material since its international trade was banned in 1989. Japan and Singapore had large shipments of ivory seized.
DNA tests were done on the Singapore ivory in an effort to determine where in Africa the ivory came from. DNA identified the source of the ivory as Zambia. Washington University's Samuel Wasser conducted DNA Studies on six tons of ivory seized in 2002, and showed it originated in southern Africa near Zambia.
Since then, ivory smuggling has increased. While the ban worked initially, the effort virtually collapsed in most of Africa. A study released on Tuesday, February 27, 2007, by wildlife/law enforcement officials concluded that the 1989 ban on international sales of ivory has been overwhelmed in the face of exploding demand for ivory in Japan and China.
Other countries submitted proposals with a variety of reasons for allowing unlimited or one-time trade in commercial ivory. Kenya, Botswana and Namibia proposed commercial trade of raw ivory between themselves, South Africa and Zimbabwe, and Botswana sought a sale of 48 tons of raw ivory it possessed. On May 23rd, fourteen African countries supported a 20-year moratorium on ivory trade to allow its elephant population to recover; however, Botswana, Nambia, South Africa and Zimbabwe submitted a contrary proposal saying they worked hard to protect their elephant populations which are now ballooning. However, Zimbabwe says an ivory ban would hurt their economy. Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa also oppose the ban because they have managed their elephant populations in a controlled manner.

A certain gene variant predisposes women to heart disease. Certain gene variations may predispose women to heart disease.
A British study found that childhood trauma can lead to heart disease. Studies show that congenital heart disease (CHD) among children AND adults have become more prevalent, air pollution is dangerous for postmenopausal women, and that childhood trauma and stress can lead to increased risks. Frequent childhood abuse increases later risk of heart disease because the body's inflammation-fighting mechanism is damaged.
Another study found that air pollution increases risk for postmenopausal women. Studies show that congenital heart disease (CHD) among children AND adults have become more prevalent, air pollution is dangerous for postmenopausal women, and that childhood trauma and stress can lead to increased risks.
Heart disease can be predicted by measuring blood levels of the peptide NT-proBNP, released by the heart when under stress. A 2007 study found that when the heart is under stress, the blood appears to contain higher levels of a protein known as NT-proBNP and suggested testing for this protein for advance warning of a heart attack. A simple blood test for peptides in the blood may identify persons with high risk of heart disease. One blood test could help determine who is at risk for heart attack, stroke and death. Measuring this level could provide advance warning of possible heart attack.
A Greek study showed that men who took regular 30 minute naps were significantly less likely to die from a heart attack. Sleep is beneficial and regular naps decrease heart disease risk. Reduce stress through naps. A Harvard study concluded napping was more likely than diet or physical exercise to lower the incidence of heart disease. A 2007 Harvard School of Public Health study of Greek men concluded that napping was more effective than diet or physical activity in lowering heart attacks and other heart disease.
It adds parental history of heart attack before age 60 and C-reactive protein measurement to traditional factors of age, smoking habits, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and levels of good cholesterol. The AMA Journal asserted that for women, in addition to the five diagnostic factors for heart disease,  family history and C-reactive protein (or inflammation) are important considerations. Scientists researching a better way to measure heart disease risk among older women concluded that family history and blood levels of C-reactive protein should be added to existing criteria.
The American Heart  Association advised women to cut their risk by eating oily fish twice a week, eating  more fresh fruits, stopping smoking, taking a baby aspirin daily, and exercising daily. Take oily fish and low dose aspirin supplements daily in addition to exercise and diet. Eating oily fish, taking baby aspirin daily, and exercising helps prevent women's cardiovascular disease.

He instructed an 8-member review group to provide a report in 45 days, and warned that senior military leaders could be disciplined. Defense Secretary Robert Gates on February 23, 2007, named an independent review panel to investigate outpatient care at Walter Reed Medical Center. The Defense Department said it is reviewing the way wounded service members are cared for. He promised to appoint an independent fact-finding commission to report within 45 days. Defense Secretary Gates was concerned the government didn't uncover the problems itself.
Washington Post newspaper reports revealing poor living conditions of the approximately 700 outpatients housed on or near the Center's grounds and bureaucratic neglect regarding their treatment had prompted Congress and veterans groups to demand remedial steps. The President demanded an immediate investigation and reparations. The White House, congressional leaders and the Defense Department called for a swift investigation and repair of the problems plaguing Walter Reed Medical Hospital outpatient Building 18.
A Washington Post editorial said that while the facilities at Walter Reed are being fixed the administrative problems causing them getting little publicity. Improvements are underway at the hospital.

A portrait of his past showed a disturbed youth who had been a ward of the state and spent time in substance abuse and mental health counseling after he displayed homicidal tendencies towards his stepmother. The perpetrator of a shooting rampage at an Omaha mall spent over four years in a series of treatment centers, including two psychiatric hospital stays, group homes and foster care after threatening at age 13 to kill his stepmother. Records show that he spent four years in a series of treatment centers, group homes and foster care after threatening to kill his stepmother in 2002. Robert Hawkins appeared to have a troubled past. He spent four years in treatment centers, group homes and foster care after threatening to kill his stepmother in 1982.
State officials who dealt with Hawkins said there was no indication that he was harmful in this way. However, nothing in his files indicated that he was capable of that kind of violence.

Over 1,500 2 yr. olds were affected in 2004-2005. In 2004-5, 1500 U.S. children under 2 suffered serious health problems.
The FDA has issued a public health advisory, banned future manufacture of  hydrocodone products for children, and launched a review of decongestant, antihistamine, cough suppressant and expectorants use for children. On March 1, 2007, the Food/Drug Administration (FDA) started a broad safety review of children's cough/cold remedies. A US Food and Drug Administration review of the safety and effectiveness of cough and cold medicines for children under two suggested that all of these ''infant'' drugs should be removed from the market, and measurement devices should be standardized to reduce risks of overdosing.
Pediatricians and public health officials petitioned the FDA  to ban marketing cough and cold medicines for children under six. The FDA is urged to ban OTC cold products for children under 6 and will consider action in October.
About 800 pediatric cold products sold in the US contain some 39 drugs considered unsafe for young children. OTC pediatric medications, of which 800 are sold, have caused convulsions, heart problems, breathing trouble, neurological complications, brain scarring, seizures, and 123 deaths.
Because children and adults react differently to medicine, it called for new research to test products in children. Few clinical studies have been done on their effectiveness.
And while the same panel voted 21-1 to ban them for infants, the vote for 2-5 year olds was 13-9. The Consumer Healthcare Products Association asserted that the drugs were both safe and effective for children under 6. An FDA panel voted 21-1 to ban use of OTC cough and cold medicines for children under 2. About 800 pediatric cold products sold in the US contain some 39 drugs considered unsafe for young children. An FDA expert panel urged the FDA to ban over-the-counter cough and cold medications for children under 6 as ineffective and possibly dangerous. An expert FDA panel voted to ban over-the-counter cold products for children under age 6. The American College of Chest Physicians, the Center for Disease Control and the American Academy of Pediatrics expressed concern about the use of over-the-counter cough and cold medications for children under 6.

Lake Mead is a primary reservoir of Colorado River water which supplies millions of million people and a million acres of farmland. The Colorado River, a key water source for seven southwestern U.S. States and Sonora, Mexico, has undergone severe droughts since 2000. As a result, its two biggest reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell have become half empty, and may never completely refill. Sharing of the Colorado river water is critical to keep the reservoirs of Lake Powell and Lake Meade filled. Drought, since 1999, has left the largest reservoirs on the river, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, half full.
Attention has focused on the Colorado River, which supplies water to 25 million people and millions of acres of farm and ranch land in seven states. Lake Mead is a primary reservoir of Colorado River water which supplies millions of million people and a million acres of farmland. This river supplies water to crop/ranch lands and 25 million people.
If current trends continue, Mead might never completely refill. Some experts say they might never refill. As a result, its two biggest reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell have become half empty, and may never completely refill.
Several states, California, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Wyoming  and Mexico are suffering from a drought, with no relief in sight. These seven states, with the federal government signed an agreement to share the water from the Colorado river. Attention has focused on the Colorado River, which supplies water to 25 million people and millions of acres of farm and ranch land in seven states. A newly-signed seven-state accord establishes specific Lake Mead water-levels as triggers for stringent water conservation measures. This emergency has forced Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico, California, Nevada and Arizona to forge an agreement in 2007 on how to handle this situation Federal officials have reached agreement with the states on how water is to be allocated in the event of a shortage.
Prolonged drought, population growth, and the prospect of climate change have compelled officials in the Southwestern states to take measures to manage their water supplies. The states are now focusing on water conservation regulations. A newly-signed seven-state accord establishes specific Lake Mead water-levels as triggers for stringent water conservation measures.
A Scripps Institution of Oceanography study indicates that Lake Mead has a 50% chance of becoming unusable by 2021 if the current unsustainable demand for water remains unchanged and if climate change follows current forecasts. Earlier, in February, a study relying on historical records and computerized climate models was released by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, warning that Lake Mead had a 50 percent chance of being unusable by 2021. Lake Meade, the vast reservoir for the Colorado River water could be run near dry by 2021, according to study by scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

Vick was temporarily banned from the NFL and his career is in jeopardy. The NFL has told Vick to stay away from training camp. Vick is barred from training camp while the NFL investigates.
The dogs were reported killed in fighting, shot, hanged, or drowned. The indictment also stated that dogs found unfit for fighting were often killed, and that Vick was consulted in one such death.
Animal rights groups protested. The allegations detailed in an indictment sparked protests and awareness campaigns by animal rights groups.
The charges stem from an April drug search which turned up 66 dogs and dogfighting equipment. On April 25 investigators conducting a drug search at Vick's home found 66 dogs and dog fighting equipment.
Investigators found dogs and Bad Newz Kennels dogfighting equipment on Vick's property in Surry County, Virginia. On April 25 investigators conducting a drug search at Vick's home found 66 dogs and dog fighting equipment. The case began on April 25th, when 66 dogs (55 pitbulls) and dogfighting equipment were found on property owned by Vick in Surry County, Virginia.
Co-defendants Purnell Peace and Quanis Phillips scheduled plea agreements before Judge Henry Hudson. Because of the potential new charges and the news that his remaining co-defendants are scheduled to enter guilty pleas this week, Vick's attorneys are trying to negotiate a plea deal that would limit his prison time and save his NFL career.
Federal prosecutors will seek a superseding indictment that includes an additional charge under the RICO statute and potentially 20 years in prison. Additionally, the prosecutor said he was seeking to bring racketeering charges against Vick, which could result in a 20-year sentence. These charges fall under US racketeering law and carry a potential 20-year prison sentence.
Because of the potential new charges and the news that his remaining co-defendants are scheduled to enter guilty pleas this week, Vick's attorneys are trying to negotiate a plea deal that would limit his prison time and save his NFL career. According to Atlanta/Virginia newspapers, as of August 15th, Vick's lawyers reportedly were trying to negotiate a plea with federal prosecutors that might limit his jail time, and allow him to return to professional football.
Vick will likely make a plea that limits his prison time but is waiting to hear from the NFL about consequences to his career. Vick has not yet decided whether to plead guilty.
At least four people are dead, 79 injured and about 30 are missing. A major interstate highway bridge in Minneapolis buckled and collapsed into the Mississippi during evening rush hour on 8/1/07 killing at least four people and injuring 79 others as 50 vehicles plummeted into wreckage and strong currents. At least six people were killed and 79 injured when steel arched 8 lane bridge collapsed over the Mississippi River plunging vehicles and massive chunks of concrete into the rushing waters.
The death toll is expected to change, as divers search for bodies trapped underwater. Divers were looking for survivors and bodies.
At the time of the accident construction closed several lanes and a jackhammer was in use. The bridge was undergoing repairs at the time. The bridge, which was found to have structural deficiencies in 2005, was undergoing repairs when it collapsed.
However, a report to to the federal government designated the bridge as structurally deficient. Inspection two years ago found structural deficiencies, but did not call for closure or immediate repair. The 40 year old bridge was recently inspected and judged to need a deck replacement in 2020 or beyond. The bridge, which was found to have structural deficiencies in 2005, was undergoing repairs when it collapsed.
The governor said the bridge had been inspected and had no major problems. Inspection two years ago found structural deficiencies, but did not call for closure or immediate repair.
Terror attack was ruled out as a cause. Terrorism was ruled out. Homeland Security says there was no sign of terrorism.
The first step of a federal investigation will be to recover and reassemble pieces of the bridge. An investigation is set to determine cause of the collapse.
The official death toll is at five, not counting those who fell in the river in their cars and drowned. The death toll is now five, with at least eight still missing. Three days after the Minneapolis bridge collapse the death toll stood at five, with eight people missing.
Saturday, the Mississippi's murky, swirling waters hampered recovery efforts, forcing divers to suspend operations to recover bodies they could see trapped below in the I-35W Bridge wreckage. Divers located four submerged cars.
President Bush toured the area Saturday and promised to expedite federal aid to rebuild the bridge. Stepped up inspections and federal funds have been earmarked for a replacement bridge. President Bush visited the scene with Governor Pawlenty, promising help to fund and expedite rebuilding.
Authorities don't know the cause of the collapse, but believe this may offer a clue. Only the north half of the bridge collapsed, causing most of the damage.
In 1990 and in 2005 the federal government gave the Minneapolis I-35W bridge that collapsed into the Mississippi river on Aug 7 a rating of ''structurally deficient'' but not in need of urgent replacement. Minnesota officials were warned in 1990 that the collapsed freeway bridge was structurally deficient and warned again in a 2005 federal government report. Minnesota officials were warned as early as 1990 that bridge was ''structurally deficient.'' Reviews of earlier inspections and comments by experts identified possible causes, including metal fatigue and scouring of pier foundations by river currents, with construction activity and heavy traffic as exacerbating conditions.

Kempthorne added his department is not taking a position on why the ice is melting; that's beyond the scope of the Endangered Species Act. Government balked because it would mean limiting global warming, and prevented scientists from speaking freely. The administration has prohibited its scientists, when acting as government representatives, from linking human factors to polar bears and global warming.

Greenland cut its bear hunt quota. Greenland cut its polar bear hunting quota.
Beloved polar bears could disappear. Environmentalists cite declines in polar bear populations and forecasts of possible extinction in fifty years and argue that only action against climate change can save the bears for future generations.
Conservation groups pressured the Interior Department to deem the bears ''threatened'' in order to force Federal recognition of the science of global warming and to act against it, noting lack of any alternative strategy for preserving the bears' habitat. Recently the Interior Secretary agreed under pressure from environmental groups to propose designating polar bears as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Environmental groups sued to force a ''threatened'' designation requiring the U.S. to create a polar bear recovery plan.
On December 27, 2006, U.S. Interior Secretary, Dirk Kempthorne, announced a proposal to list the polar bear as a threatened species because of sea ice loss. The polar bear has become a symbol for the dire effects of global warming as Arctic icepack, critical for its survival, has shrunk. Polar bears depend on sea ice to travel, hunt, and give birth, but ice is melting due to global warming caused by industrial emissions. Polar bears depend on ice for travel and hunting for food.

Polar bears depend on sea ice to travel, hunt, and give birth, but ice is melting due to global warming caused by industrial emissions. In December 2005, three conservation groups sued the federal government blaming global warming for sea ice melting.
A recent US Geological Survey report cited the UN's prediction that sea ice off Alaska will probably shrink to nearly half the area it covered in 1980, with profound effects on mammals dependent on sea ice. Bears become stranded with limited food on land and on floes over Arctic depths.
Bears are smaller now and fewer cubs survive. Studies show worrisome effects on polar bears in different areas, e.g. much smaller and thinner pregnant females than 25 years ago.
More than 500,000 people commented on a government proposal to list polar bears as ''threatened'' under the Endangered Species Act, reflecting a widespread and unprecedented sense of urgency about their fate. More than 500,000 people commented.
A recent US Geological Survey report cited the UN's prediction that sea ice off Alaska will probably shrink to nearly half the area it covered in 1980, with profound effects on mammals dependent on sea ice. In September, the U.S. Geological Survey released a report basically stating that even with drastic worldwide reductions in greenhouse gasses, the polar ice cap will continue to shrink for the next 50 years wiping out most of the bears habitat. Shrinkage of sea ice continues apace.

Both studies found that taking 2000 international units of vitamin D3 daily, and a little sunshine could cut breast cancer cases by half and colorectal by two-thirds. Studies have revealed that raising vitamin D levels may help prevent colorectal cancer by two-thirds and breast cancer by half. The studies found a possible 50% reduction in breast cancer and 66% in colon cancer in  whites.
The two major studies were conducted by a core team of cancer prevention specialists at the Moores Center at the University of California. Two new vitamin D studies, published by Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, in February 2007, revealed new prescriptions for preventing breast and colorectal cancers.
Both studies found that taking 2000 international units of vitamin D3 daily, and a little sunshine could cut breast cancer cases by half and colorectal by two-thirds. An important source of vitamin D is sunshine which may explain people in warmer climates have more of it and a lower incidence of these cancers than people in more northern areas. Vitamin D3 is available through diet, supplements, and exposure of the skin to sunlight.
Vitamin D is also available through supplements and certain foods. Vitamin D3 is available through diet, supplements, and exposure of the skin to sunlight.
A U.S. National Cancer Institute study published October 30, 2007, found no sign that vitamin D lowers the overall risk of dying from cancer. An NIH study of the correlation between vitamin D and overall cancer survival found no correlation except for colorectal cancer. It found no sign that vitamin D lowered the overall risk of dying from cancer except for significantly lowering the risk of death from colorectal cancer. Vitamin D increases did not lower the incidence of cancer a 17,000 person decade study by the National Cancer Institute concluded.
The federal government plans to update its vitamin D guidelines. Recent research indicating vitamin D may have multiple health benefits has ignited a debate over whether federal guidelines are insufficient, leaving millions vulnerable to diseases.
The study cautioned that the issue is far from settled and advised people not to assume vitamin D is a cure-all and consume large doses. Johanna Dwyer of NIH cautioned that the public should not assume that vitamin D is a magic bullet and consume high amounts.
Researchers found non-whites absorb the suns light at lower levels. A University of Toronto study found that non-white ethnic groups have insufficient levels of vitamin D, putting them at higher risk for debilitating diseases.

Wall Street financier Bernard Madoff was arrested on December 11, 2008 and charged with securities fraud after he allegedly confessed to his sons that he had swindled investors out of $50 billion through a giant pyramid scheme.
For decades Madoff appeared to be remarkably successful, but when investors requested the return of about $7 billion in principal at the end of 2007, Madoff confessed his business was a giant Ponzi scheme. The scheme unfolded when his sons asked how he pays bonuses and not investors.
SEC critics say that the Bush appointed agency is ineffective. Madoff's arrest on charges of securities fraud raised serious questions about the U.S. financial regulatory system.
The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) liquidated Madoff's firm. Four days later a federal judge appointed Irving Picard as trustee to liquidate Madoff's firm. The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) is liquidating the Madoff Investment firm following his arrest on a securities fraud charge.

U.S. District Court for NY's Southern District appointed Irving H. Picard as trustee and Baker & Hostetler as Picard's counsel. Four days later a federal judge appointed Irving Picard as trustee to liquidate Madoff's firm.
Following Madoff's confession of fraud to his two sons, they reported the confession to the FBI. Sons Andrew and Mark turned him in.
It was not clear to investigators how one person could commit such massive fraud, but there was no evidence that any of Madoff's family members was involved. Bernard Madoff insisted that no family member was involved in the Ponzi scheme and Federal investigators found no evidence of family member involvement. No evidence surfaced that Madoff's family helped him.
China faces water shortages because of rising temperatures (global warming), increased use by growing population, pollution of water from rapidly growing industry,  and need for dams for electrical power. The most serious of these issues is water shortages. SW China is experiencing a severe water shortage due to reduced rainfall, strains of economic and population growth, and disappearing glaciers and faster evaporation caused by global warming. Already a dry country, China faces severe water shortages as increased evaporation, due to higher temperatures, reduces supply even as ever more is needed for a growing population and expanding industrial and agricultural production.
China faces water shortages because of rising temperatures (global warming), increased use by growing population, pollution of water from rapidly growing industry,  and need for dams for electrical power. River levels dropped sharply to record lows in 2007, after bad droughts, hurting fish stocks, navigation and drinking water supply and worsening pollution.

China faces water shortages because of rising temperatures (global warming), increased use by growing population, pollution of water from rapidly growing industry,  and need for dams for electrical power. Drought from reduced rainfall and rising average temperatures has significantly reduced China's grain production  so that China will have to continue to import grain to feed its growing population.
Hydropower plants are ordered not to store water for electricity generation. Since some municipalities have ordered hydropower plants not to store water for electricity generation, restrictions on power usage have imposed temporary blackouts of large stores, hotels, industrial manufacturers and civilian homes.
Government officials recognize a critical need to build ''a water-saving society,'' changing many everyday practices. China has introduced new measures to counter water shortages which worsened in 2007 because of low rainfall and increasing temperatures.

Investigators hypothesized that nylon slings supporting winches used in installing the collar may have snapped if they were worn, damaged, or overloaded. Investigators believe a piece of nylon webbing may have failed while hoisting a six-ton piece of steel, causing the failure. While this accident will cost millions, investigators now suspect that a $50 piece on nylon webbing may have failed while hoisting a six-ton-piece of steel. A $50 piece of nylon webbing that broke may have started the accident.
One expert said a sling's ragged end looked like a tensile failure. Bradley Closson of Craft Forensic Services, California, said: "That's definitely a tensile failure."
Much of the trade in human organs takes place on the black market. Their aim is to encourage organ donations while preventing any black market trade in organs. Black market organ trafficking has occurred in Russia, China and the Philippines. In some countries, such as China and Russia, organ trafficking has become a problem. Governments and medical authorities around the world are undertaking to formulate regulations covering organ transplants.
US organ transplant guidelines are being changed to allowed heart transplants for infants with different blood types. More organs could become available through South Carolina's plan to shorten prisoners' sentences in exchange for organ donations, mismatched blood type organ transplants for infants, and promotion of brain-death idea for organ donation in China.
New federal standards for transplant programs were unveiled in March. On March 22, 2007, U.S. federal health officials unveiled new standards that hopefully will result in a decrease of patient deaths and failures of transplanted organs.

Liver splitting is being used more often recently to increase the number or liver transplants. Liver-splitting techniques and the ''donation after cardiac death'' approach to organ harvesting have markedly increased the number of organs available to those in need. More organs are becoming available as doctors increase harvesting after the heart stops rather than waiting for brain-death, and through liver-splitting.
