Menu Foods' recall has prompted the filing of a class action lawsuit in Canada and several individual lawsuits in U.S. courts. Several law suits, including a class action suit have been filed by pet owners whose pets died.
The cause of the crash was not immediately known, but transportation officials thought the aircraft might have hit an ''air pocket,'' a phenomenon not unknown in that region. The cause of the crash is not known at this time but it is possible bad weather was a factor.
Rescue teams, assisted by local residents, reportedly found the wreckage in the mountainous region of West Sulawesi. Search teams arrived at the crash scene on the following day and found 12 survivors, all in critical condition. Emergency crews, dispatched Tuesday at dawn, found the wreckage at 8:29 a.m.
Authorities believe the plane was flying at 8,000 rather than 35,000 feet, making it vulnerable to air disturbances. One flight expert attributed the accident to an air pocket, and the plane's failure to fly at 35,000 feet.
No signals from the plane's emergency locator were detected. No transmissions from its emergency locator have been detected.

A recent US Geological Survey report cited the UN's prediction that sea ice off Alaska will probably shrink to nearly half the area it covered in 1980, with profound effects on mammals dependent on sea ice. Shrinkage of sea ice continues apace.

The two major studies were conducted by a core team of cancer prevention specialists at the Moores Center at the University of California. Two new vitamin D studies, published by Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, in February 2007, revealed new prescriptions for preventing breast and colorectal cancers.
Both studies found that taking 2000 international units of vitamin D3 daily, and a little sunshine could cut breast cancer cases by half and colorectal by two-thirds. Vitamin D3 is available through diet, supplements, and exposure of the skin to sunlight. An important source of vitamin D is sunshine which may explain people in warmer climates have more of it and a lower incidence of these cancers than people in more northern areas.
Vitamin D3 is available through diet, supplements, and exposure of the skin to sunlight. Vitamin D is also available through supplements and certain foods.
Recent research indicating vitamin D may have multiple health benefits has ignited a debate over whether federal guidelines are insufficient, leaving millions vulnerable to diseases. The federal government plans to update its vitamin D guidelines.
Johanna Dwyer of NIH cautioned that the public should not assume that vitamin D is a magic bullet and consume high amounts. The study cautioned that the issue is far from settled and advised people not to assume vitamin D is a cure-all and consume large doses.
A University of Toronto study found that non-white ethnic groups have insufficient levels of vitamin D, putting them at higher risk for debilitating diseases. Researchers found non-whites absorb the suns light at lower levels.
A US study raised questions about vitamin D and cancer. Vitamin D increases did not lower the incidence of cancer a 17,000 person decade study by the National Cancer Institute concluded. A U.S. National Cancer Institute study published October 30, 2007, found no sign that vitamin D lowers the overall risk of dying from cancer. An NIH study of the correlation between vitamin D and overall cancer survival found no correlation except for colorectal cancer.
Helicopters located 3 life rafts with 30-40 survivors but heavy weather prevented picking them up so they dropped food and drink to them Some survivors in life rafts had been spotted by aircraft, and food and water was dropped to them, but continued bad weather was hampering rescue attempts. Emergency rations were dropped to those who could not be picked up in the rough seas The bad weather has made the rescue attempts very difficult, with food and water being dropped to people in life boats.
Survivors thought hundreds of passengers had probably gone down with the ferry. Many passengers could not escape the sinking ship and perished immediately.
Indonesia has widened the search for the hundreds missing after a car ferry sunk at the end of Dec 2006. Strong winds and the sea currents have carried the survivors for 100s of miles, therefore the search had to be widened. from where the ferry was thought to have sunk, prompting officials to expand the search zone further east. Indonesia widened the search for survivors of the December 29 disaster after 13 were rescued Wednesday clinging to an oil rig 350 kilometers away.
They are threatened by pollution, overfishing; climate change, coastal development, deforestation, unrestricted tourism; destructive fishing methods, over-harvesting for commercial trade and ship groundings. Fishing trawlers endanger the spiny dogfish, which travels in schools and is slow to reproduce. Reefs are vital ecosystems which support diverse undersea populations, protect shores from storms and generate billions in trade and tourism dollars.
Destruction of sea coral and other specific animal and plant species are under increasing scrutiny because of over harvesting, pollution, bleaching by warming temperatures and other destructive causes.

According to NOAA officials, 40 percent of all fish caught commercially breed in coral reefs. A quarter of all marine species need reefs to live and grow, and 40% of commercially-caught fist need them to breed.
They are caught in fishing nets and lines, pollution makes them sick and kills them, some are killed for meat and their shells. All seven of the world's species of sea turtles are endangered and face serious threats from commercial fishing nets and pollution, and some species are hunted for their meat or their shells. Turtles are poached for their shells,  medicinal properties, and meat. Sea turtles face a host of threats around the world.
A loggerhead turtle that has outgrown his Atlanta aquarium will be released off the Georgia coast. The Atlanta aquarium is sending a turtle raised there to the sea with a tracking device. Conservation efforts for sea turtles continue with radio tracking of green turtles in Pakistan, Georgia Aquarium raising and releasing into the wild of loggerhead turtle, beach nesting preserves in Texas and in Taipei, hatching and raising of a Beal's four-eyed turtle in a Tennessee aquarium, and scientists, conservationists from the Asian Development Bank trying to raise funding to protect the sea turtle populations in Indonesia, Malaysia and other Pacific island nations.
Pakistan has organized patrols to monitor beaches where green sea turtles nest, and Taiwan bars tourists from designated beach areas during the nesting season.

There are 11 major state-level water and soil conservancy projects in operation. Officials have made soil conservation measures a priority for several years and claim to have made significant progress in reversing soil erosion through government mandated conservation regulations, but  erosion owing to overgrazing, water-table depletion, deforestation, and economic development  has continued to outpace the government's efforts.
Soil erosion and desertification is affecting large areas in China from problems such as overgrazing and over farming. Soil erosion in China is caused by overgrazing, deforestation, hillside farming, mining, urban sprawl, and global-warming abetted droughts. Soil erosion plagues much of China, turning arable land into uninhabitable desert. Soil erosion is a critical problem for China, which has 7 percent of the world's arable land but 20 percent of the world's population.
Desertification causes $7 billion in economic loss annually. Erosion is particularly severe in western China, where desertification has produced some $7 billion in annual economic costs.
The government is investing $2.46 billion dollars in northwest China to reverse desertification by planting trees, upgrading irrigation facilities, and setting up monitoring stations. Forestation, upgraded irrigation, better monitoring and training are part of this effort.
Soil erosion affects 40% of China's territory, with 4.52 billion tons eroded annually. China, with an estimated 40 percent of its territory suffering from soil erosion, is taking conservation measures all over the country.
