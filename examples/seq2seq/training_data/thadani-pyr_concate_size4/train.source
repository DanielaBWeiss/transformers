Design of the euro note was underway. The design of the Euro is required to include five languages and the symbol of the EU. By 1996, euro design development begins.
The Euro was scheduled to be launched on January 1, 1999, and preparations for its introduction were well underway three years before that date. Most reaction was positive as the Jan. 1, 1999 date for introduction of the euro approached. Prior to the scheduled January 1999 introduction of the euro, polls indicate most European Union citizens are in favor of it and believe it will be successful. European Union (EU) nations agreed that a single currency (the Euro) will go into effect on January 1, 1999.
Few German companies have prepared for the transition. Technical preparations continued and although most German companies were not yet ready for the change, the Bundesbank predicted in early 1998 that private investors would benefit.
In early 1996 many EU countries continued to fear that the Euro would cause them to loose financial sovereignty; however, by late 1997 Germany was encouraging its companies and investors to welcome the Euro, stressing that it would expand investment opportunities, reduce currency risks, and increase competition. Some economists worry about loss of financial sovereignty; others worry about rising unemployment and interest rates.
However, only 20% feel well informed about upcoming changes. Eighty percent in six countries say they are not well informed.
"EUR" will be the currency code. In 1997, the code "EUR" is ascribed to the euro. By April 1996 a consultative group was in place to design the new currency and a year later a new currency code was issued to facilitate technical preparations.

Germany was still experimenting with striking euro coins, but France led in production followed by Finland, Belgium and Spain. By mid-November 1998 France, Finland, Belgium, and Spain had begun to produce euro coins and Germany was "in an advanced stage" of experiments to strike them. Germany is preparing to do so.
The Vatican, San Marino and Monaco are entitled to use the Euro as their official currency but cannot issue any currency unless they agree to EU conditions. Meanwhile such small independent countries as Monaco were left subject to special arrangements and conditions imposed by the European Union.

ERA's second uranium mine in the Kakadu World Heritage Area would generate billions of US dollars in revenue and create 2,000 jobs. The government defended their decision saying the mine would generate millions of revenue dollars and create 2,000 jobs.
In October 1997, the Australian government gave permission to Energy Resources of Australia (ERA) to open the Jabiluka uranium mine on the edge of the Kakadu National Park which is on the World Heritage List, in Australia's Northern Territory. ERA's second uranium mine in the Kakadu World Heritage Area would generate billions of US dollars in revenue and create 2,000 jobs. The mine is in Kakadu National Park, which is on the UNESCO World Heritage list of important cultural and environmental sites. After a decade of opposing new uranium mines, the Australian government approved construction of the Jabiluka mine in the Kakadu National Park, which is on the World Heritage List.
The government's decision was condemned by environmentalists, who were concerned with the potential for consigning tons of radioactive waste in an environmentally sensitive area, and by opposition parties, who claimed the government ignored the wishes of Aboriginal people in the area. Conservationists and the Aboriginal "Mirrar" owners of the land oppose the mine while ERA insists that its environmental record has been proven by the 16-year operation of the Ranger mine, also located in the Kakadu Park. Opposition parties, conservationists and Aboriginal land owners opposed the planned mine. Aboriginal landowners threatened to block mine development.

McKinney's defense team hoping to save him from the death penalty, conceded that he was guilty of manslaughter. Jason Tangeman, one of McKinney's defense lawyers, conceded that McKinney was responsible for Shepard's death.
At McKinney's trial in October, McKinney's attorney pleaded that McKinney committed manslaughter in five minutes of "gay panic" to a sexual advance from Shepard, because drug and alcohol addicted McKinney had been abused homosexually at age 7 and had consensual homosexual sex at 15. In attempting to get his client a life sentence rather than the death penalty, he argued that McKinney's past, which included sexual abuse as a child, caused him to lash out in rage at Shepard's sexual advances. His defense attorneys maintained that Aaron's judgement on the night of the murder was affected by alcohol, methamphetamines and sexually traumatic events in his life which caused him to react in a moment of rage or "gay panic." The prosecution countered by saying there could not be a conspiracy of two people who pretend to be homosexuals, commit a robbery and murder, then claim homosexual panic.

By late December of 1998, a revamped Swiss/British team, with conditional permission from China to fly over its terrain, prepared for a third attempt at the feat. Piccard and Brian Jones made a third attempt aboard the Breitling Orbiter III.
They began their Atlantic crossing on their 18th day aloft. On their 18th day aloft, the balloonists began crossing the Atlantic on the last leg of what was expected to be a successful, non-stop, around-the-world balloon flight.
Having gotten permission before their departure, they passed over southern China. They gained vital time by obtaining flight permission from China before taking off. Piccard got Chinese airspace clearance before starting but was limited to a narrow strip, forbidden north of the 26th parallel.

The largest passenger airliner ever built, the Airbus 380(A380), took off on its maiden four-hour flight on April 27, 2005 in France. The European Airbus A380 flew its maiden test flight from France 10 years after design development started.
The A380 super-jumbo passenger jet surpasses the Boeing 747 and breaks their monopoly. The European company, Airbus, is the newest competitor with the Boeing Company.
The A380 is designed to carry 555 passengers, but can be expanded to 800 seats. The A380, carrying between 555 and 840 passengers, was unveiled in January 2005 and test flown in April.
U.S. airlines have not placed an order. No US airline has ordered the jet yet.
Commercial deliveries begin first quarter 2006 to Singapore. First commercial deliveries to Singapore Airlines are scheduled for 2006.
Toulouse production started in January 2002. A Toulouse, France assembly line opened in 2004.
Airbus has 159 firm orders and 10 options from 16 clients. With 159 orders from 16 customers and 100 options, production fell behind demand, raising the price to U.S. $292 million.
The US is studying the potential for turbulence generated by the A380 reflecting safety precautions. The U.S. is investigating whether the jet will need special safety regulations due to the turbulence it generates. Possible A380 air turbulence problems potentially requiring ICAO rule-making, a wing load test failure and passenger injuries during a simulated evacuation did not slow deliveries. France called unreasonable a US-proposed safety review to determine whether A380 turbulence would require greater distances around the plane.
Airlines are seeking millions in damages contractually agreed upon for delays. In 2005 the A380 was six months behind schedule and owed millions in buyer compensation. By June 1, 2005 customizing A380s for 15 different client requirements, notably for different passenger entertainment systems, had delayed deliveries up to 8 months, risking millions in penalties. Airbus executives say the company will have to pay millions in compensation for late deliveries of the A380.
The A380 has passed its emergency evacuation test, an important component toward the super jumbo's official certification for commercial flights. 873 passengers and crew exited under 80 seconds and the A380 passed the test. A wing ruptured during a February 2006 stress test but the plane qualified in emergency evacuation, an important step towards certification.
In Antarctica and the Artic, ice melts are causing complex questions about the impact of global warming. Ice continues to melt at an alarming rate in both the Arctic and Antarctic.
New satellite photos show that Arctic ice is melting faster than before and that air temperatures are rising sharply. Arctic sea ice is melting faster.
Its area is down 20% and it all could disappear this century. Arctic sea ice is melting faster.
23 countries recently met in Greenland to encourage governments to act on global warming instead of arguing. Several international meetings have been held to address the issues of global warming and climate change. A group of countries, which fringe the Artic waters, met to discuss measures to reduce greenhouse emissions.
Climate change could thaw the top 11 feet of permafrost in most areas of the Northern Hemisphere by 2100 altering ecosystems across Alaska, Canada and Russia according to a US study. Arctic permafrost thaw releases warming greenhouse gases, which will increase permafrost melting up to 11 feet deep by 2100.
Mine safety procedures have been ignored in the quest for profits, especially by those mines owned or partly-owned by local officials. Officials are often illegally invested in mines and ignore safety procedures for production.
During the first nine months of the year, there were 2337 accidents killing 4228 miners. January-September 2005 there were 2337 coal-mine accidents killing 4228 people, up 8.5 percent from the rate in 2004. This year 4,228 miners were killed in 2,337 coal mine accidents.
Accident and death rates continue to increase at China's provincial coal mines, while rates decrease at state-owned facilities. Despite such measures the rate of large-scale accidents increases with accidents reported on a near-daily basis.
In December 2005 the government announced that it had dismissed two provincial deputy governors, prosecuted 96 officials and demoted or dismissed 126 other officials blamed for accidents killing 528 people.

Recognized cyber-security improvements need to be implemented more comprehensively, especially against documented threats from Al-Qaida, and older, less secure equipment replaced. Electrical grid vulnerability has grown as equipment is controlled through the Internet or phone, older equipment becomes susceptible to attack, and electric companies' cybersecurity remains inadequate. Many analysts believe the biggest threat to the power grid is from companies using older equipment that is more susceptible to attack and their reluctance to update to new computers.
An electromagnetic pulse could damage electrical power systems. Security experts warned that terrorists could unleash electromagnetic bombs that can be catastrophic. Electric power networks are vulnerable to physical attacks (conventional explosives or nuclear electromagnetic pulse) and computer attacks (external or internal) against the internet-based supervisory control and data acquisition computers and networks that remotely control power generation and transmission.

During the night of July 17, a 23-foot tsunami hit the north coast of Papua New Guinea (PNG), triggered by a 7.0 undersea earthquake in the area. A tsunami ravaged the northern coast of Papua New Guinea during  the night of 17 July 1998, when a magnitude 7.0 undersea earthquake caused a 23 foot wall of water to strike the West Sepik Province villages of Aitape, Nimas, Warapu, Arop, and Teles-Lambu. On a Friday night in mid-July 1998, a 23-foot tsunami engulfed a heavily populated area near Aitape on Papua New Guinea's remote northwest coast. A 23-feet tsunami struck the remote northwest coast of Papua New Guinea the night of Friday 17 July, totally destroying three villages and almost completely destroying another.
Most of the dead were children and old people. The death toll, mostly children and old people, has reached 59 but is expected to rise to more than 1000 and there are thousands of injured and homeless, with no food or water.
The tsunami followed 30 minutes after an undersea earthquake 18 miles off the coast, measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale. The tidal wave was caused by an undersea earthquake measuring about 7.0 on the Richter scale some 12 miles off the coast. A tsunami ravaged the northern coast of Papua New Guinea during  the night of 17 July 1998, when a magnitude 7.0 undersea earthquake caused a 23 foot wall of water to strike the West Sepik Province villages of Aitape, Nimas, Warapu, Arop, and Teles-Lambu.

The disease if characterized by the loss of cells producing the neurotransmitter dopamine, the protein alpha-synuclein, and clumping of proteins in the brain. Parkinson's disease is a degenerative nerve disorder in which certain proteins, such as alpha-synuclein, clump abnormally around brain cells. Parkinson's, usually not inherited, is associated with Lewy bodies in the brain, the protein alpha-synuclein, mutations of chromosome 12 genes, and dopamine loss.
Parkinson's disease is a degenerative nerve disorder in which certain proteins, such as alpha-synuclein, clump abnormally around brain cells. Parkinson's is a degenerative brain disease characterized by tremors, stiffness and difficulty walking. Parkinson's is a degenerative brain disease. Parkinson's is a slowly progressing brain disease extensively researched in the U.S., as it affects 1.5 million Americans, sufferers including Muhammad Ali, Janet Reno, and Michael Fox.
Sufferers include world leaders and celebrities and 1.5 million Americans. Parkinson's is a slowly progressing brain disease extensively researched in the U.S., as it affects 1.5 million Americans, sufferers including Muhammad Ali, Janet Reno, and Michael Fox. It affects 1.5 million Americans, including Michael J. Fox, Muhammad Ali and Janet Reno, also Pope John Paul II and possibly Yasser Arafat.
Parkinson's is a degenerative brain disease characterized by tremors, stiffness and difficulty walking. Parkinson's involves the loss of cells that produce the neuro-transmitter dopamine, leading to tremors and stiffness and a deterioration of mobility and speech. Patients have tremors, difficulty pronouncing words, and rigid and slow movement. Symptoms include difficulty in walking and pronouncing words, tremors, and stiffness.
Many hope stem cell research--well funded in California--will find a cure. Embryonic stem cell research may contribute to a cure. Supporters of embryonic stem cell research are hopeful it will lead to the amelioration of Parkinson's.
Trials have found deep brain stimulation may help alleviate symptoms. Deep brain stimulation is an approved therapy to relieve Parkinson's. Deep Brain stimulation could alleviate symptoms.
Tobacco may protect against Parkinson's. Studies show smoking may slightly delay the onset of Parkinson's. Tobacco may provide some protection.
Mere anticipation of a drug sometimes seems helpful. Treatment anticipation caused patients' improvement.
Research continues to combat Parkinson's, which usually affects people later life, over 1 percent of plus 65's having it. Parkinson's disease starts in middle to late life.
Stem cell research was also to begin in Switzerland and South Korea. Switzerland and South Korea will allow stem cell research.
On Sept 30, Merck voluntarily recalled the  pain killer Vioxx, used by almost 2 million, after clinical trials for its use in colon cancer showed unacceptable rates of stroke/heart attack. On September 30, Merck & Co. voluntarily withdrew its arthritis drug Vioxx, prescribed for some 20 million people worldwide, because recent scientific study results indicate that long-term use significantly increases patients' risk of heart attack and stroke over those taking older NSAID drugs. In 2004, Merck withdrew arthritis drug Vioxx, approved in 1999. VIOXX, an arthritis drug used by 2 million people, was withdrawn from the market by Merck, after determination that use past 18 months increased the risk of heart attack or strokes, one researcher estimating a resultant 30,000 to 100,000 deaths.
The FDA said it would strengthen its system for reviewing drug safety and would appoint a special drug safety director. Responding to criticism that it should have acted sooner, the FDA announced that it would strengthen its system for reviewing the safety of drugs already on the market. Under Congressional scrutiny, the FDA is changing procedures to elevate attention to and action on drug safety. The FDA demands longer testing before approving Arcoxia, already sold in 48 countries.
Nonetheless, Merck maintains it was vigilant in monitoring and disclosing information about the safety of Vioxx and disagrees with reports to the contrary. Both Merck and FDA have contested criticisms on their actions related to Vioxx.
Other drug companies rushed to fill the VIOXX vacuum but people were calling for greater review of such drugs. A blitz of drug company advertising urging use of other drugs in place of Vioxx is bewildering patients. With the market demise of Vioxx,  intense competition developed for the lucrative arthritis pain medication market.
The H5N1 strain of Influenza A, commonly termed bird flu, has resurfaced, this time in Hong Kong, where there has been 10 confirmed cases with 4 deaths, victims not restricted to age or sex. A mysterious, deadly influenza strain, H5N1, has appeared in Hong Kong with nine confirmed and ten suspected cases. In a 1-month period, 10 suspected cases were reported and 9 confirmed, including 4 deaths.
The World Health Organization has debated vaccine development and further says it has not become an epidemic and recommend those seemingly exposed build up body resistance through good diet, rest, and exercise. There have been no cases of this "bird flu" outside Hong Kong. Nearby Macao reports no cases.
Chicken exports from the mainland are suspended until better health tests are established. The Central Chinese government temporarily suspended chicken exports.
Preliminary tests indicate that the virus is transmitted from bird to human. A joint Hong Kong, U.S., WHO examination of the problem confirmed that the main mode of H5N1 virus transmission was bird-to-human.
Neighboring Macao officials were concerned but reported no cases. Nevertheless, Macao is prepared for a possible outbreak.
Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania recognized that the Bay's environmental decline severely affected their economies and in 2000 agreed to actions to save the bay within 10 years, removing it from the national "impaired water" list. The Chesapeake Bay's once thriving populations of fish, crabs, and oysters are vanishing and the industries surrounding them have all but collapsed, because the Bay has been over harvested and is heavily polluted from sewage, animal manure, and fertilizers from farms. Life in the Chesapeake Bay is threatened by over-harvesting, pollution, parasites, and the introduction of non-native species. Important bay water filters and indicators of the bay's health, oysters were once the mainstay of the region's fishing industry.
Multiple challenges, organizations, and viewpoints hamper attempts to reverse decline and improve conditions of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. So far, Chesapeake Bay cleanup efforts have been ineffective.
The Ramseys' attorney, Hal Haddon, said that they don't trust the Boulder police. They deny any involvement and claim police are biased against them.
No one has been charged in the case although both Alex Hunter, Boulder's district attorney, and Mark Beckner, Boulder's police chief, have said that JonBenet's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, fall under "the umbrella of suspicion." No suspects have been named or arrests made but parents John and Patsy Ramsey are under suspicion. No charges have been filed.
Evidence points to both a family member and intruder. Under State law, grand jury proceedings are secret but media speculation says evidence points to either a family member or an intruder having committed the murder. In addition to her family, an intruder could be the perpetrator based on some evidence including an unidentified footprint and unidentified DNA. Although prosecutors have only identified the parents as under suspicion, unidentified DNA material in JonBenet's underwear and a shoe print found near the body suggest the possibility of an intruder.
A French goat has become the first known case of MCD in a non-bovine animal. A French goat was diagnosed with mad cow in 2002, the first known transference to a different specie. A goat in France is infected with BSE, the first case of transmission to another species used for human consumption.
Meanwhile British researchers have discovered a gene that might make some people more resistant to MCD. One gene may protect some people from this disease or create different symptoms according to researchers at University College, London. Research at University College, London suggests that an individual's susceptibility to vCJD varies with genetic makeup.
The first death in Japan from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease occurred in February 2004. Japan had its first MCD casualty - a man infected during a stay in Britain.
Reports from Greek air force pilots who intercepted the doomed airline suggest that a catastrophic loss of cabin pressure could have caused the crash. The probable cause was a catastrophic loss of cabin pressure that starved people of oxygen. It is suspected a malfunction in the oxygen system caused  a catastrophic loss of cabin pressure. Greek fighter pilots, scrambled to intercept the unresponsive Boeing 737, saw an unconscious pilot in the cockpit and oxygen masks dangling in the cabin, suggesting a catastrophic loss of air pressure.
Another man onboard, probably a flight attendant, attempted to steer the plane just before it crashed. A crew member with pilot training attempted in vain to control and land the plane, and the final cause of the crash was that the jet ran out of fuel. Flight attendant Andreas Prodromou, a student pilot, tried to land the plane but it ran out of fuel and crashed.
The plane's data and cockpit recorders, though damaged, were sent to France for expert examination. Both recorders have been sent to France for analysis.
The plane may have suffered a sudden loss of cabin pressure aggravated by a switch left in the wrong position. There are media reports that a switch that controls cabin pressure may have been left in the wrong position after a safely check.
The same plane lost cabin pressure in December after a door was improperly sealed. The same aircraft lost cabin pressure in December when a door was not properly sealed.
Banks and businesses lose up to an estimated $4 billion annually. Identity theft is the fastest growing crime in America with 350,000 people victimized yearly and $4 billion losses annually for businesses.
It is estimated that up to 350,000 people are victimized by IT each year. Identity theft is the fastest growing crime in America with 350,000 people victimized yearly and $4 billion losses annually for businesses.
Identity theft is the fastest-growing crime, and one which evolves with each advance in technology. It is one of the fastest growing crimes in the world. Identity theft, assuming another person's identity, is the fastest growing crime in America. Identity theft is the fastest growing crime in America with 350,000 people victimized yearly and $4 billion losses annually for businesses.
Most thefts involve acquiring Social Security and Credit Card numbers. Stealing an identity requires only a social security number and one other personal information item (i.e. mother's maiden name) and takes victims years to recover. "Identity Theft" (IT) is stealing someone's Social Security number, credit card numbers of other identifiers and using them to gain fraudulent credit.
It now offers a toll-free identity theft help line. An IT hotline established by the Federal Trade Commission in 1999 received about 400 calls per week.
Three Arab nations are successful with hypnotism. Kuwait, Egypt, and Lebanon  have had great success in using hypnotism to combat obesity. Kuwait, Egypt, and Lebanon have reported successful use of hypnotism in treating obesity. Hypnotherapy is being used successfully on obesity in several countries.
Obesity is a chronic disease requiring regular medical treatment and a commitment by patients to control their weight. Obesity is a chronic disease and likely to become the preeminent public health problem.
In 1997 about 33% of the U.S. population is overweight compared to 25% in the 1960's. Obesity is increasing throughout the world because of Western-style diets and less physical activity.
Even some Japanese police officers are too heavy. Obesity can cause skeletal problems and some forms of cancer, and prevents Japanese police from doing their job.
About 33-50% of the U.S. population is overweight and obesity is the second-leading cause of preventable death, causing an increase in diseases that were heretofore on the decline. In 1997 about 33% of the U.S. population is overweight compared to 25% in the 1960's.
Obesity is a chronic disease and likely to become the preeminent public health problem. Obesity contributes to over 300,000 excess deaths each year and is, after smoking, the second leading cause of preventable deaths in the U.S.  To fight obesity it must be recognized as the serious public health problem that it is. Obesity is a serious health problem in the U.S. where one-fourth of the population is obese.
To preserve rain forests in Yunnan Province, China stopped building sugar factories, resettled itinerant farmers, provided armed patrols, and nearly doubled its nature reserve size. In China the government set up a tropical primary forest protective zone in Hainan province in 1951. China is establishing and expanding nature reserves, closing intrusive small companies and sugar factories, moving farms, arresting poachers, stopping illegal lumbering, and protecting gibbons, which have high research value.

Malaysia is cooperating with Brazil in the launch of satellites to monitor their tropical forests. Brazil and Malaysia will jointly launch satellites to monitor tropical forests. Malaysia has a joint satellite project with Brazil to monitor rain forests and analyze the satellites' data.
Healthy forests prevent erosion and water pollution and help cleanse the air. Environmentalists and scientists are devising programs to protect rain forests, which aid the climate by cleansing air, and which between 1980-1995 diminished by 450 million acres. Rain forests cleanse the air and protect water supplies from pollution.
The wide-ranging African hornbill helps reseed rain forests. California biologists determined that hornbills must be protected because they reseed the forests.
The investigation expanded to include present and former government officials and wealth stashed abroad. In November 1998, following months of demands for an inquiry and statements from the government suggesting  one was going on, the investigation became part of a general decree calling for the removal of all traces of corruption, collusion, and nepotism amongst current and former officials, their families and cronies, and businesspersons.

An Aruba official said there was no evidence to support a murder charge and as of July 16 no charges have been issued. Massive searches by Dutch marines, FBI, Aruba police, and volunteers, have found no physical evidence of murder.
The assailants, carrying AK-47s and a rocket launcher, claimed to be members of a small radical Muslim group fighting for an independent state in the Philippines. The Philippine Muslim rebel group Abu Sayyaf, who demanded the release of Arab terrorists held in US prisons, claimed responsibility, although authorities were skeptical. The Philippine rebel group Abu Sayyaf claims responsibility but authorities are skeptical. A Philippine Muslim separatist group, Abu Sayyaf, claimed responsibility for the abductions, but neither this claim nor location of the 20 captives has been confirmed.
Eight days after the abduction, rebels allowed a doctor and several journalists to visit the hostages, held on a southwest Philippine island by 50 or more gunmen. On April 26, 2000 Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado confirmed the hostages' location in Sula Province and that Abu Sayyaf participated in the abduction. Hostages are held by 40-50 gunmen in Talipao in Sulu Province. Philippine officials confirmed the hostages kidnapped from the Malaysian island Sipadan were being held somewhere on the Philippine island of Sulu by the Abu Sayyaf group, who was demanding a $2.4 million ransom.
Nur Misuari isn't replaced as negotiator. President Joseph Estrada appointed Nur Misuari, governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, as the government's negotiator with the kidnappers who were demanding U.S.$2.4 million in ransom. The Philippine Government was negotiating for their release, refusing a rebel demand for direct negotiations with the captives' countries.
Kidnappers threaten to behead hostages if MNLF head Abu Sayyaf rejected Nur Misuari and threatened to behead some of the hostages.
From October 1998 to February, food produced in the United States was tainted with Listeria, E. coli, enterotoxigenic E. coli, and lead, causing recalls of products. One recall for E. coli and one recall of baby food containing lead resulted in no illnesses. In November, IBF recalled beef possibly containing E-coli, which causes kidney failure and anemia. According to the FDA, between 1988 and 1998 there was a fivefold increase in food products recalled for E.coli and Listeria bacteria and other life-threatening contaminants.
In response to an outbreak of food poisoning, the government and/or company can recall the products and stop production operations, but the consumer must check product codes, cook meats to 165 degrees, separate raw foods and uncooked meats, and wash hands and cutting tools thoroughly. The Agriculture Department urged consumers to return all recalled products and to properly handle, cook, and store food.

Rigid food safety practices are the best way to avoid infection. The Agriculture Department urged consumers to return all recalled products and to properly handle, cook, and store food.
The Agriculture Department urged consumers to return all recalled products and to properly handle, cook, and store food. It was considering requirements for more industry testing.
The President proposed giving increased authority to food agencies. In July 1998 President Clinton asked for more money and authority for the Food and Drug Administration, to facilitate faster recalls, warning labels, and a food safety research institute.
In addition to US food products contaminated with Listeria and E.coli bacteria, other products were also being recalled because the packages did not warn that they contained the possible allergens buttermilk, whey, and genetically engineered corn. In February, Advance Food recalled steak because of non-disclosure of allergen content buttermilk and whey. Other 2000 recalls include taco shells for containing bioengineered corn, a possible allergen; steak products for containing buttermilk and whey, allergens not listed on the label; and beef slated for school lunch programs because the meatpacker failed to meet USDA quality standards. Products have been recalled because they fail to meet USDA quality standards or because their production areas were unsanitary;  meat products because of listeria monocytogenes and E. coli bacteria;  taco shells because they were made with genetically engineered corn that had not been approved for human consumption; and other foods because their labels have failed to identify allergens such as buttermilk or whey as possible ingredients.

In September, Kraft recalled taco shells containing genetically engineered corn not approved for human consumption.
However, a hitch developed when a judge balked, wanting more information and changes to the plea. Ric Ridgeway of the State Attorney's Office said new plea deal would be proposed. Objections by a Marion County judge may change the plea deal.
In response, Marion prosecutors then dropped all charges, concluding that the emotional welfare and privacy of the victim was more important than sending LaFave to prison. That afternoon, prosecutors dropped Marion county charges and the penalties against Lafave remained those in the Hillsborough agreement. The Debra LaFave saga ended in March 2006 when Marion County prosecutors dropped all charges against the teacher. Marion County prosecutors dropped the charges against Deborah Lafave after they concluded that the victim's emotional state was more important than a prison sentence for Lafave.
On Wednesday, March 8, a psychiatrist testified a trial would harm the boy. He also was presented with psychiatric opinions concerning damage to the victim's emotional state that a trial could cause.
She was approached by Matt Lauer and Nancy Grace, the British tabloid News of the World wrote of the "school miss". Media attention motivated the victim's mother to seek such a decision.
That afternoon, prosecutors dropped Marion county charges and the penalties against Lafave remained those in the Hillsborough agreement. This means the previously agreed-upon deal will stand. The outcome negated the decision of Marion County Judge Stancil, who felt prison would be appropriate for LaFave. Therefore, LaFave will live under the plea deal reached in Hillsborough County of three years house arrest and seven years probation.
Japan plans to seek permission to expand its so-called research whaling program when the International Whaling Commission (IWC) meets in late May, intending to nearly double its annual catch of minke whales and to hunt endangered humpback and fin whales.

New York state law requires bicycle riders, in-line skaters and skateboarders under 14 to wear helmets. Helmets are required for participants in baseball, football, equestrian events, in-line skating, and hockey. Helmets can protect baseball batters, skateboarders and in-line skaters and are required in some states. New York is the 7th state to require helmets for skateboarders; cyclists and inline skaters already covered by law.
New traffic laws in Argentina and Uganda require motorcycle helmets. Laws mandating the use of seatbelts and cyclist helmets should be enforced. In some jurisdictions motorcyclists are required to wear helmets. Countermeasures include cyclists' helmets' being mandatory in Argentina and Uganda, strongly advised in the ASEAN nations, and recommended for Australian cowboys and mounted sheepherders.
Motorcyclists continue to protest wearing a helmet and 52% of motorcycly fatalities were not wearing one. In 2003, 52 percent of fatally injured motorcyclists were not wearing helmets.
Twenty states require helmets for all riders; other states have under-18 rules. In 2004, only 20 states require this helmet. Washington, D.C. and 20 states mandate helmets now.

but ephedra can harm people with hypertension. It can be dangerous to people with certain underlying health problems.
The agency will try to find new ways to address safety concerns. On February 25, the FDA notified Congress that it is launching a new push to address public safety issues posed by ephedra use. In 2000 the FDA launched a new push to address ephedra's safety issues and include warning labels.
Small doses can trigger devastating reactions in people with unknown susceptibilities. However, despite reports that even small doses can trigger devastating reactions, industry research maintains it is safe in proper doses.
Up to half of the world's mangroves have disappeared in the last 20-30 years because of the development of tourist resorts and commercial prawn farming. Up to half of the world's mangrove swamps have disappeared in the last 20-30 years because of the development of tourist resorts and shrimp farms. Eased regulations allowing development of tourist, transportation, and aquaculture facilities have caused half the world's mangrove swamps to disappear in the last 30 years.
Bangladesh's project to protect the Sundarbans, part of the world's largest remaining mangrove area, lost funding. Malaysia made additional efforts for protection, Sri Lanka enacted laws for protection, Bangladesh sought unsuccessfully to obtain loans for forest protection, and Indonesia gave first priority to forest conservation.
The mangrove forests took a terrible beating and more than 60,000 acres of mangroves were seriously harmed, but the forests absorbed much of the power of the waves and thus helped to protect the coastline and save lives. Over 60,000 acres of coastal mangroves were damaged.
Snorre A and neighboring Vigdis were shut down for over a month, costing 205,000 barrels of oil daily. A November 2004 natural gas leak on Norwegian Statoil's Snorre A oil platform in the North Sea caused the shutdown of production from Snorre A and neighboring platform Vigdis, resulting in a cut in oil output of 205,000 barrels a day for Norway and costing Statoil 1.4 million Euros daily. On November 28, 2004 Norway's Statoil closed the SnorrA and Vigdis oil platforms in the North Sea. Most workers were evacuated and oil production halted.
The leak was contained then Statoil began pumping drilling mud into the injection well. Operator Statoil pumped in drilling mud to push back gas and seal the leak with cement, in constant contact with technical experts.
This closure dropped Norway's production by 205,000 barrels per day, costing Statoil $1.8 million a day. Statoil is losing $1.8 million daily. A November 2004 natural gas leak on Norwegian Statoil's Snorre A oil platform in the North Sea caused the shutdown of production from Snorre A and neighboring platform Vigdis, resulting in a cut in oil output of 205,000 barrels a day for Norway and costing Statoil 1.4 million Euros daily.
Full 205,000 bpd was approved January 24th, after restarted production stabilized and repairs were complete. Two months after a November 2004 natural gas leak halted production on two of Norwegian Statoil's oil platforms in the North Sea, the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority (NPSA) approved the company's plan to resume full 205,000 barrel a day production. Full production permission was given in late January but achieving it will take time said Statoil. Approval to resume full production at the two Statoil platforms was given on January 24.
This was attributed to inadequate planning and risk appreciation and failure to observe safety rules. Statoil admitted the leak resulted from inadequate planning and appreciation of risk, and failure to observe governing documentation. Statoil's internal investigation acknowledged inadequate planning and a lack of risk appreciation led to the leak.
Norwegian safety officials issued a highly critical report on Statoil's failures and ordered improvements in four key areas, including improving management involvement and compliance with controlling documents. An investigation by Norwegian state officials in coordination with NPSA for possible criminal negligence revealed 28 failures to meet regulations before the leak, harshly criticized Statoil, and ordered comprehensive improvements.

There was also a dramatic increase in the number of hermaphrodites among frogs during the period when DDT and other pesticides were widely used. Frog populations are declining worldwide due to deforestation, pollution, habitat loss, climate change, pesticides, parasites, non-native predators, the fungal disease chytridiomycosis, hermaphroditic frogs caused by DDT and Atrazine, and over-harvesting for food and medicine. Threats to amphibian survival include chemically polluted streams, destruction of rain forests, pesticides which can trigger hermaphroditism, climate change, thinning ozone layer, over harvesting for food and medicine, and even the closing of Australia's only frog hospital.
Amphibians' permeable skins and habitats make them an important indicator of environmental quality. Frogs are important sentinels for environmental problems because of the sensitivity of their permeable skin. Frogs are very important indicators of environmental change because their permeable skin is extremely sensitive to any changes. Scientists view amphibians as "canaries in the coal mine", their demise possibly presaging decline of human life.

Frogs are very important indicators of environmental change because their permeable skin is extremely sensitive to any changes.
Corrective actions include reducing emissions that contribute to climate change, creating parks and ecological reserves, and breeding frogs in captivity in order to sustain vulnerable species. To reverse this trend, we must protect their habitat in part by creating parks and reserves, reduce emissions, and breed them in captivity. Remedies to decline include creation of parks and reserves, reducing climate change emissions, and breeding amphibians in captivity to sustain vulnerable species. Creating ecological reserves, reducing emissions that contribute to climate change, and breeding frogs in captivity can help sustain species.

International conservation groups propose a $404 million effort to preserve frogs and other amphibians, to include describing new species, preventing habitat loss, and reducing trade in amphibians for food and pets.
The U.S. sprayed 19 million gallons of the defoliant Agent Orange (containing dioxin) over South Vietnam from 1962 to 1971, exposing two million Vietnamese and 2.1 million U.S. military. The U.S. first refused some veterans' claims but now assumes all 2 million who served in the war were exposed. Any American who served in the war is automatically presumed to have been exposed to the defoliant. It has a lingering toxic component called dioxin, which has been linked to three kinds of cancer and chemical acne among the Vietnamese and in Americans fighting there, as well as birth defects in their children.
From 1961 to 1971, American planes sprayed Agent Orange over parts of South Vietnam to deny cover and sustenance for North Vietnamese troops. Agent Orange was sprayed on jungles by US planes for 10 years to strip away cover from North Vietnamese troops. The U.S. sprayed 19 million gallons of the defoliant Agent Orange (containing dioxin) over South Vietnam from 1962 to 1971, exposing two million Vietnamese and 2.1 million U.S. military.
Also in 2000, a $140 million, 25 year, Air Force study linked Agent Orange with adult-onset diabetes and found higher incidences of heart disease and high blood pressure in victims. Evidence links Agent Orange to adult-onset diabetes. A new Air Force report acknowledges evidence linking Agent Orange to cases of diabetes, with a direct relationship between severity of the disease and levels of dioxin in the body. A controversial 2000 US Air Force report indicates "particularly strong" evidence linking Agent Orange to diabetes in veterans involved in spraying the defoliant.
Speculation grew on who poisoned Victor Yushchenko. Theories abound on who poisoned Yushchenko, when, where and why. Theories abound surrounding Yushchenko's poisoning.
If the intent was murder, dioxin was a bad choice, though Yushchenko could suffer its effects for years. This poison will disfigure and sicken a victim, but not kill quickly. Toxicologists say dioxin was a poor choice if the aim was to kill though it can sicken and disfigure, which it has done. French toxicologists wondered why dioxin was used because it is a slow killer.

The foods were all made with worcestershire sauce which contained the chili powder. Premier Foods apparently mistakenly added chili powder contaminated with the red dye to Worcester sauce made by them for Crosse and Blackwell, the sauce also incorporated into other recalled foods. Britain issued a safety alert on February 18 and began withdrawing products containing this sauce.
This dye increases the risk of cancer, although that increase is very small. However, the risk of illness is estimated to be very small based on the concentrations used. The EU has banned its use in foods because of an increased, albeit small, risk of cancer. The British agency launched an unprecedented probe but also downplayed the risk of severe illness.
Britain's Food Standards Agency ordered 474 foods recalled because they contain the dye Sudan I, used to color products like oils and shoe polish.
