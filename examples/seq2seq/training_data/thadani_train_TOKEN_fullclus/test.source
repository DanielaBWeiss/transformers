Sentence 2: The government has halted subsidies to ranchers who were turning forestland into pasture. Sentence 3: Financial incentives for forest removal were ended and burnings outlawed. Sentence 4: Subsidies for ranchers are being removed and timber policies made more restrictive. Sentence 5: Brazilian programs to reduce deforestation and CO2 emission, and promote sustainable development include "extractive reserves" which globally market renewable "rain-forest chic" products (replenishable trees, produce, nuts, latex, pharmaceutical plants); discontinuing subsidies to clear-cutting for unsustainable ranches which dislocated forest people; tree improvement; pesticide controls; minimizing roads and mineral mining impacts; increasing fish pond farming; and improving law enforcement.

Sentence 1: The big steel companies employ manufacturing methods that require immense capital investment and many labor-intensive steps in production. Sentence 2: They save time, energy, and money, undercutting integrated producers who transform iron ore into finished steel in many stages.
Sentence 1: Japan was researching direct iron ore smelting, which would eliminate expensive separate coking ovens and sinterers. Sentence 2: The Japanese are researching a method to replace the coking ovens and sinterers using one large blast furnace with two smaller furnaces attached.
Sentence 1: They believe this method will cut costs by 10% and expected it to be operational by 2004. Sentence 2: Commercial viability wasn't expected for ten years.
Sentence 1: The new technology, called thin-slab casting, sharply cuts the time and capital costs required for steel sheet production, namely by melting scrap iron rather then pig iron, then casting the steel into two-inch slabs, and rolling them into coils, all in a single production run. Sentence 2: This sharply cuts time, labor, and energy costs. Sentence 3: This process is called thin slab casting and is quicker and less capital intensive than the traditional ore to smelter process, and reduces the cost of producing a ton of steel. Sentence 4: They save time, energy, and money, undercutting integrated producers who transform iron ore into finished steel in many stages. Sentence 5: Done in mini-mills the method takes less time, uses non-union labor and a lean organizational structure, and is less capital intensive.
Sentence 1: The resulting thin slab is passed on rollers through a furnace and then goes through rolling mills, emerging as coils of hot-rolled sheet steel. Sentence 2: The thin slab is then passed on rollers through a furnace to make the temperature across its width consistent.

Sentence 1: Nucor was able to open another plant in Hickman, Arkansas and has been looking at cooperative ventures in Great Britain and Europe. Sentence 2: It also has a joint venture in Hunterston, Scotland.
Sentence 1: However, steel from mini-mills is of a grade more suitable for construction than for more demanding applications, such as car-body panels. Sentence 2: Mini-mills produce lower-grade steel for niche markets like construction.
Sentence 1: Still another new technology is strip casting which US Steel may invest in and is expected to produce a superior quality of steel. Sentence 2: Some other new technologies for steel production include using a hot rolling mill to produce thin strip casting, which US Steel believes produces a higher quality product, and using electric arc furnaces to replace the old coal-fired equipment. Sentence 3: Thin-strip casting was expected to produce higher quality than thin-slab.
